      CHAPTER I&mdash;MY MOTHER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t happened about
      six in the morning, in a large red room. A bar of sunlight streamed in at
      the window, in which dust-motes were dancing by the thousand. A man and
      woman were lying in bed; I was standing up in my cot, plucking at the
      woman with my podgy fingers. She stirred, turned, rubbed her eyes, smiled,
      stretched out her arms, and drew me under the bed-clothes beside her. The
      man slept on.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is my earliest recollection. If it be true that the soul is born not
      at the same time as the body, but at a later period with the first
      glimmering of memory, then this was the morning on which my soul groped
      its way into the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have sometimes thought that I have never grown wiser than the knowledge
      contained in that first recollection. Nothing that I have to record in
      this book will carry me much further. The scene is symbolic: a little
      child, inarticulate, early awakened in a sunlit room, vainly striving to
      make life answer questions. Do we ever get beyond that? The woman is
      Nature. The man is God. The room is the world&mdash;for me it has always
      been filled with sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother I remember as very tall and patient, vaguely beautiful and
      smiling. I can recall hardly anything she said&mdash;only her atmosphere
      and the fragrance of violets which seemed always to cling about her. I
      know that she took me out beneath the stars one night; there was frost on
      the ground and church-bells were ringing. And I know that one summer&rsquo;s
      day, on a holiday at Ransby, she led me through lanes far out into the
      country till my legs were very tired. We came to a large white house,
      standing in a parkland. There we hid behind a clump of trees for hours. A
      horseman came riding down the avenue. My mother ran out from behind the
      trees and tried to make him speak with her. She held me up to show me to
      him, and grasped his rein to make him halt. He said something angrily, set
      spurs to his horse, and disappeared at a gallop. She began to cry, telling
      me that the man was her father. I was too tired to pay much attention. She
      had to carry me most of the way home. It was dark when we entered Ransby.
    </p>
    <p>
      In London some months later&mdash;it must have been wintertime, for we
      were sitting by the fire-light&mdash;she took me in her arms and asked me
      if I would like to have a sister. I refused stoutly. At dawn I was wakened
      by hurrying feet on the staircase. Next day I was given a new box of
      soldiers to keep me quiet. A lot of strange people stole in and out the
      house as if they owned it. I never saw my mother again.
    </p>
    <p>
      All I had known of her had been so shy and gentle that it was a good deal
      of a surprise to me to learn years later that, as a girl, she had been
      considered rather dashing. She had been called &ldquo;The gay Miss Fannie
      Evrard&rdquo; and her marriage with my father had begun with an elopement. Her
      father was Sir Charles Evrard, brother-in-law to the Earl of Lovegrove; my
      father&rsquo;s folk were ship-chandlers in Ransby, outfitting vessels for the
      Baltic trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inequality of the match, as far as social position was concerned, made
      life in Ransby impossible. My father was only a reporter on the local
      paper at the time of his escapade; the Evrards lived at Woadley Hall and
      were reckoned among the big people in the county. It must have been to
      this house that my mother took me on that dusty summer&rsquo;s day.
    </p>
    <p>
      After his marriage my father settled down in London, gaining his living as
      a free-lance journalist. I believe he was very poor at the start. He did
      not re-visit Ransby until years later. Pride prevented. My mother returned
      as often as finances would allow, in the vain hope of a reconciliation
      with her family. On these occasions she would stay at the ship-chandler&rsquo;s,
      and was an object of curiosity and commiseration among the neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the facts which lie outside my own recollection were communicated
      to me by my grandmother. She never got over her amazement at her son&rsquo;s
      audacity. It was without parallel in her experience until I attempted to
      repeat his performance with an entirely individual variation. She never
      tired of rehearsing the details; it was noticeable that she always
      referred to my mother as &ldquo;Miss Fannie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Often and often,&rdquo; she would say, &ldquo;have I seen Miss Fannie come a-prancin&rsquo;
      down the High Street with her groom a-followin&rsquo;. She was always mounted on
      a gray horse, with a touch of red about her. Sometimes it was a red
      feather in her hat and sometimes a scarlet cloak. When Sir Charles rode
      beside her you could see the pride in his eye. She was his only child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After my small sister failed to arrive someone must have told me that my
      mother had gone to find her. I would sit for hours at the window, watching
      for her homecoming.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II&mdash;THE MAGIC CARPET
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> was born in South
      London on a crowded street lying off the Old Kent Road. It was here that
      my mother died. When I was about six, a false-dawn came in my father&rsquo;s
      prospects, on the promise of which he moved northward to the suburb of
      Stoke Newington.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time of which I write, Stoke Newington still retained a village
      atmosphere. The houses, for the most part, were old, bow-windowed, and
      quaint. Many of them were occupied by leisured people&mdash;retired
      city-merchants, maiden-ladies, and widows, who came there because it was
      reasonable in price without being shabby. It was a backwater of the
      surging stream of London life where one found time to grow flowers, read
      books, and be kindly. Its red, tree-shaded streets witnessed many an
      old-fashioned love-affair. The early morning was filled with country
      sounds&mdash;singing of birds, creaking of wooden-gates, and cock-crowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our house was situated in Pope Lane, a blind alley overgrown with limes.
      It had posts set up at the entrance to prevent wheel-traffic. You could
      not see the houses from the lane, so steeply did the walls rise up on
      either side. It led nowhere and was a mere tunnel dotted with doors. Did
      the doors open by chance as you were passing, you caught glimpses of
      kitchen-gardens, shrubberies, and well-kept lawns. We rarely saw our
      neighbors. Each door hid a mystery, on which a child could exercise his
      fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father was too strenuously engaged in wringing an income out of
      reluctant editors to pay much attention to my upbringing. In moving to
      Pope Lane, he had made an increase in his expenditure which, as events
      proved, his prospects did not warrant. The keeping up of appearances was a
      continuous and unrelenting fight. Early in the morning he was at his desk;
      the last thing in the evening, when I ventured into his study to bid him
      good-night, his pen was still toiling industriously across the page. His
      morn-. ings were spent in hack-work, preparing special articles on
      contemporary economics for a group of daily papers. His evenings were
      given over to the writing of books which he hoped would bring him fame,
      many of which are still unpublished.
    </p>
    <p>
      He coveted fame and despised it. He wrote to please himself and expected
      praise. He was an unpractical idealist, always planning huge undertakings
      for which there was no market. His most important work, which occupied
      twenty years of his life, was <i>The History of Human Progress</i>. It was
      really a history of human selfishness, written to prove that every act
      which has dug man out of the mire, however seemingly sacrificial and
      noble, had for its initial motive an enlightened self-interest. He never
      managed to get it before the public. It was disillusionizing. We all know
      that we are selfish, but we all hope that with luck we could be heroes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trouble with my father was that he was an emotionalist ashamed of his
      emotions. He wanted to be scrupulously just, and feared that his
      sentiments would weaken his judgments. Temperamentally he was willing to
      believe everything. But he had read Herbert Spencer and admired the
      academic mind; consequently he off-set his natural predisposition to faith
      by re-acting from everything accepted, and scrawled across the page of
      recorded altruism a gigantic note of interrogation. He gave to strangers
      and little boys the impression of being cynical and hard, whereas he had
      within him the smoldering enthusiasms and compassion which go to the
      kindling of martyrs and saints. He was planned for a man of action, but
      had turned aside to grope after phantoms in the mazes of the mind. His
      career is typical of the nineteenth century and sedentary modes of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back I often wonder if he would not have been happier as a
      ship-chandler, moving among jolly sea-captains, following his father&rsquo;s
      trade. How many hours, mounting into years, he wasted on literary failures&mdash;hours
      which might have been spent on people and friendships. As a child I rarely
      saw him save at meal-times, and then he was pre-occupied. For some years
      after my mother&rsquo;s death he was afraid to love anyone too dearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He solved the problem of my immediate existence by locking the door into
      the lane, and giving me the freedom of the garden. I can recall it in
      every phase. Other and more recent memories have passed away, but, when I
      close my eyes and think back, I am there again. Moss-grown walks spread
      before me. Peaches on the wall ripen. I catch the fragrance of box,
      basking in sunshine. I see my father&rsquo;s study-window and the ivy blown
      across the pane. He is seated at his desk, writing, writing. His face is
      turned away. His head is supported on his hand as though weary. I am
      wondering why it is that grown people never play, and why it is that they
      shut smaller people up always within walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw nothing of the outside world except on Sundays. My father used to
      lead me as far as the parish church, and call for me when service was
      ended. He never came inside. His intellectual integrity forbade it. He was
      an agnostic. My mother, knowing this, had made him promise to take me. He
      kept his word exactly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few friends called on us. My companions were cooks and housemaids. I
      borrowed my impressions of life, as most children do, from the lower
      orders of society. A servant is a prisoner; so is a child. Both are
      subject to tyranny, and both are dependent for their happiness on
      omnipotent persons&rsquo; moods and fortunes. A maidservant is always dreaming
      of a day when she will marry a lord, and drive up in a glittering carriage
      to patronize her old employer. A child, sensitive to misunderstanding, has
      similar visions of a far-off triumph which will consist in heaping coals
      of fire. He will heap them kindly and for his parents&rsquo; good, but
      unmistakably.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in Pope Lane that I first began to dream of a garden without walls.
      As I grew older I became curious, and fretted at the narrowness of my
      restraint. What happened over there in the great beyond? Rumors came to
      me; sometimes it was the roar of London to the southward; sometimes it was
      the sing-song of a mower traversing a neighbor&rsquo;s lawn. I dreamt of an
      unwalled garden, through which a child might wander on forever&mdash;an
      Eden, where each step revealed a new beauty and a fresh surprise, where
      flowers grew always and there were no doors to lock.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a book which gave the first impulse to this thought; in a sense it
      was responsible for the entire trend of my character and life. In recent
      years I have tried to procure a copy. All traces of it seem to have
      vanished. If I ever knew the name of the author I have forgotten it. I am
      even uncertain of the exact title. I believe it was called <i>The Magic
      Carpet</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mine was a big red copy. The color came off when your hands got sticky. It
      had to be supported on the knees when read, or the arms got tired. It was
      a story of children, ordered about by day, who by night went forth
      invisible to wander the world, riding on the nursery carpet. Absurd! Yes,
      but this carpet happened to be magic. All you had to do was to seat
      yourself upon it, hold on tight, and wish where you wanted to be carried.
      In a trice you were beyond the reach of adults, flying over roofs and
      spires, post-haste to the land of your desire. In that book little boys
      ate as much as they liked and never had stomach-ache. They defeated whole
      armies of cannibals without a scratch. They rescued fair ladies, as old as
      housemaids, but ten times more beautiful, who wanted to marry them. No one
      seemed to know that they were little. No one condescended or told them to
      run away and wash their faces. Nobody went to school. Everybody was
      polite.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pictures which illustrated the adventures still seem in remembrance
      the finest in the world. They typify the spirit of romance, the soul of
      youth, the revolt against limitations. They appealed to the lawless
      element within me, which still yearns to straddle the stallion of the
      world and go plunging bare-back through space.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried every carpet in the house, but none of ours were magic. I lay
      awake imagining the lands, I would visit if I had it. I would go to my
      mother first, and try to bring her back. I remembered vaguely how
      care-free my father had been when we had had her with us. Perhaps, if she
      returned, he would be happy. Then an inspiration came; there was one
      carpet which I had <i>not</i> tested&mdash;it lay before the fire-place in
      my father&rsquo;s study. But how should I get at it? Only in the hours of
      darkness was it different from any other carpet, and in the evenings my
      father was always there. I never doubted but that this was the carpet; its
      difficulty of access proved it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night I lay awake, pinching myself to stave off sleep. It was winter.
      Outside I could hear the trees cracking beneath the weight of snow upon
      their boughs. The servants came to bed. I saw them pass my door, casting
      long shadows, screening their candles with their hands lest the light
      should strike across my eyes and rouse me. I waited to hear the study-door
      open and close. In waiting I began to drowse. I came to myself with a
      shudder. What hour it was I could not guess. I got out of bed. Stealing to
      the top of the stairs I looked down; all was blackness. Listening, I could
      hear the heavy breathing of sleepers. Bare-footed, I crept down into the
      hall, clinging to the banisters. The air was bitter. I was frightened.
      Each step I took seemed to cause the house to groan and tremble. The door
      of the study stood open. By the light of the fire, dying in the grate, I
      could just make out the carpet. Darting across the threshold, I knelt upon
      it. &ldquo;Take me to Mama,&rdquo; I whispered. The minutes ticked by; it did not
      stir. I spoke again; nothing happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard a sound in the doorway&mdash;a sudden catching of the breath. I
      turned. My father was standing, watching me. I did not scream or cry out.
      He came toward me through the darkness. What with fear of consequences and
      disappointment, I fell to sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think he must have seen and overheard everything, for, with a tenderness
      which had something hungry and awful about it, he gathered me in his arms.
      Without a word of question or explanation, he carried me up to bed. Before
      he left, he halted as though he were trying to utter some thought which
      refused to get said. Suddenly he bent above the pillow, just as my mother
      used to do, and kissed me on the forehead. His cheeks were salty.
    </p>
    <p>
      As my eyes closed, a strange thing happened. The snow lay on the ground
      and there were no flowers, but the room was filled with the fragrance of
      violets.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III&mdash;THE SPUFFLER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>ne day there was a
      ring at the door in the lane, followed by a loud and impatient rat-a-tat.
      A gentleman, who was a stranger to me, hurled himself across the
      threshold. He wore the frown of one who is intensely in earnest, whose
      mind is very much occupied. His mustaches were the fiercest and most eager
      that I ever saw on any man. They stuck out at right angles from under his
      nose like a pair of shaving-brushes. They were of an extraordinary
      purplish color, and would have done credit to a pirate. But his dress was
      more clerical than sea-faring. It consisted of a black frock coat, bound
      with braid at the edges where the cloth was fretted; his vest was low-cut
      to display an ocean of white shirt, above which a small tie of black silk
      wobbled. Hurrying up the path, tugging at his bushy eye-brows, he
      disappeared into the house. The last I saw of him was a red bandana
      handkerchief, streaming like a danger-signal from his coat-tail pocket. I
      thought he must be one of those hostile publishers my father talked about
      or, at the very least, an editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetty, the maid, came into the garden looking worried. She did not stand
      on the steps and yell, as was customary, as though daring me to disobey
      her. She caught up her skirts with a dignified air and spoke my name
      softly, employing the honeyed tones with which she enticed our milkman
      every morning. I perceived at once that something momentous had occurred,
      and came out from behind the bushes. Then I saw the reason for her sudden
      change of manners&mdash;the purple mustached stranger was watching us from
      behind the curtains of my father&rsquo;s study-window. I was most agreeably and
      unpresentably grubby. Hetty was distressed at my appearance; I knew she
      was by the way she kept hurting my hand and muttering to me to hide behind
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we got inside the house she became voluble, but only in whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Master Dante, I can&rsquo;t &rsquo;elp it if the soap do get into your
      mouth. You&rsquo;ve got to be a clean boy fer once in yer h&rsquo;existence. It may
      mean h&rsquo;everythin&rsquo;. That gent&rsquo;s some relation o&rsquo; yourn. &rsquo;E&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;
      to take you away wiv him, an&rsquo; he may &rsquo;ave money. I shall &rsquo;ate
      to lose yer. Now let&rsquo;s look at yer neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She scrubbed away at my face till it was scarlet; she let the water from
      the flannel trickle down my back. I was too awe-inspired to wriggle; by
      some occult power the dreadful personage downstairs might learn about it.
      Having been pitched into my Sunday sailor-suit and squeezed into a pair of
      new boots and prickly stockings, I was bundled into the august presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I entered he was straddling the fire-place carpet&mdash;the one which
      ought to have been magic&mdash;and waggling his coat-tails with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father rose from his chair. &ldquo;This is your great-uncle, Obadiah
      Spreckles. Come and be introduced, Dante.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up to now I had never heard of such a relative, but I came timidly forward
      and shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fine little fellow. A very fine little fellow, and the image of his
      mother,&rdquo; said my great-uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father winced at the mention of my mother. My great-uncle spread his
      legs still wider and addressed me in a jerky important manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got a lot of dogs and cats. Got a goat and a cow. Got some hens. Got up
      early this morning. Saw the sun shining. Thought you might like to take a
      look at &rsquo;em, young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning to my father, &ldquo;Well, Cardover, I must be going. I&rsquo;ll take good
      care of him and all that. I&rsquo;m very busy&mdash;hardly a moment to spare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before I knew what had happened, I had said good-bye to my father and was
      standing in the lane alone with my strange uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the door had banged and he knew that no grownup could see him, he
      changed his manner. His hurry left him. Placing his hands on my shoulders,
      he looked down into my face, laughing. &ldquo;Now for a good time, old chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the lane, where the posts blocked the passage, stood a
      little dog-cart and pony. My bag was stowed under the seat; at a click of
      the tongue from my uncle, the little beast started up like the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bright June morning. The sky was intensely blue and cloudless.
      The air was full of flower-fragrance and dreamy somnolence. I had seen so
      little of the world that everything was vivid to me, and touched with the
      vagrant poetry of romance. Tram-lines were streaks of silver down the
      streets, shops were palaces, cabbies gentlemen who plied their trade
      because they loved horses. Postmen going their rounds were
      philanthropists. Everyone was free, doing what he liked, and happy. In my
      child&rsquo;s way I realized that neither my father nor myself was typical&mdash;not
      all little boys were locked in gardens and not all grown men slaved from
      morning to midnight. A great lump came into my throat. It would have been
      quite easy to cry, I was so glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Obadiah kept chatting away, telling me that the name of his little
      mare was Dollie and how he came to buy her. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t afford it, you know,
      old chap. She costs me ten shillings a week for fodder. But when I saw
      that coster whacking her, and she looked up into my eyes when I went to
      stop him, I just couldn&rsquo;t resist her. She seemed to be asking me to buy
      her, and I did. You should have heard what your Aunt Lavinia said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the way along the streets he kept pointing with his whip to things
      that he thought were interesting. He engaged me in conversation&mdash;a
      thing which no one had thought worth doing. He asked me questions which
      were not senseless, and seemed to suppose that a child had reasoning
      powers. I was flattered, and began to surprise myself by the boldness of
      the things I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      We rattled down the City Road, past the Mansion House, over London Bridge
      to the Elephant and Castle, and so out toward Dulwich till we came within
      sight of the Crystal Palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to slow down and grow pensive, as though working out a problem.
      &ldquo;You see, she&rsquo;ll have lunch ready. She&rsquo;s expecting us. She&rsquo;s very precise
      about the keeping of hours and won&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo; Then, &ldquo;Hang it all. We may
      as well have a holiday now we&rsquo;re out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shaking loose the reins we started forward again, racing everything we met
      upon the road. My uncle&rsquo;s high spirits returned. I don&rsquo;t know where we
      went. I know there were woods and farm-houses. We stopped for lunch at a
      village-inn. It stood on the edge of a gorse-common. On the common a
      donkey was grazing. A flock of geese wandered across it. Boys were playing
      cricket against a tree-stump. Several great wagons, piled high with
      vegetables, were drawn up, the horses with their heads deep in nose-bags.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had our meal in the tap-room with the wagoners. While they were present
      my uncle assumed his pontifical manner, addressing me as &ldquo;young man&rdquo; and
      them as &ldquo;my good fellows.&rdquo; He was very dignified, and benevolent, and
      haughty. They were much impressed. But when they had left and we were
      alone, he winked his eye at me solemnly, as much as to say &ldquo;that was all
      pretense. Now let&rsquo;s be natural,&rdquo; and entered once more into my boy&rsquo;s world
      of escapades and gilded shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the mare rested, we strolled round. In a hollow of the woods we came
      across a gipsy encampment. Three yellow caravans were drawn up together. A
      fire was burning in the open, over which an iron pot was suspended from a
      bough. A fierce, gaudily clad woman was bent above it stirring. She looked
      up at sound of our approach and the big ear-rings which dropped upon her
      neck jangled. Recognizing my uncle she nodded, and allowed us to sit down
      and watch her. Presently a rough man came out of the woods and threw
      himself down beside us. A young woman returned from fortune-telling, with
      her baby in a shawl across her shoulders. Bowls were brought out, and we
      had a second lunch from the great pot bubbling on the fire. Pipes were
      produced; the women smoked as well as the men. My uncle asked them where
      they had been and how they had fared since last he saw them. I listened
      intently to their answers; it seemed that they must have discovered the
      boundless garden of which I had only dreamt.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dog-cart on the homeward journey, I learnt that my uncle was
      acquainted with a number of queer people. &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s interesting,
      Dante,&rdquo; he said, by way of excuse and explanation; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s never safe to
      despise anyone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In course of conversation he informed me that he had always longed to be a
      gipsy, but had never dared. When I asked why not, he answered shortly,
      &ldquo;Your Aunt Lavinia&mdash;she&rsquo;s not like us and wouldn&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if there wasn&rsquo;t any Aunt Lavinia&mdash;would you dare then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have to,&rdquo; he said, smiling grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t know at all what he meant. He didn&rsquo;t intend I should. After all
      these years those words, chance-spoken to a child, remain with me. They
      were as near to a confession that his wife supported him as was possible
      for a proud man.
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandmother Cardover at Ransby, whose sister he had married, had a
      habit of nicknaming people with words of her own invention. She called my
      great-uncle The Spuffler. Whether the verb <i>to Spuffle</i> is Suffolk
      dialect or a word of her own coining, I have never been able to find out&mdash;but
      in its hostile sense it described him exactly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A spuffler is a gay pretender, who hides his lack of success beneath the
      importance of his manners. Time is his one possession, and to him it is
      valueless; yet he tries to impress the world with its extreme rarity. A
      spuffler is always in a hurry; he talks loudly. He plays a game of
      make-believe that he is a person of far-reaching authority; he deceives
      others and almost deceives himself. He is usually small in stature and not
      infrequently bald-headed. In conversing he makes an imaginary lather with
      his hands and points his finger, at you. He may splutter and spit when he
      gets excited; but this is accidental and not necessary. The prime
      requisite is that he should affect the prosperity of a bank-president and
      be dependent on some quite obscure source for his pocket-money. Since I
      have lived in America I have become familiar with a word which is very
      similar&mdash;<i>a bluffer</i>. But a bluffer is a conscious liar and may
      be a humorist, whereas a spuffler does all in his power to deceive himself
      and is always in dead earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a curious fact that the men whom I loved best as a child were all
      three incompetents in the worldly sense. They were clever, but they lacked
      the faculty of marketing their talents. They were boys in men&rsquo;s bodies.
      With children they had the hearts of children and were delightful. With
      business men their light-heartedness counted as irresponsibility and was a
      drawback. In two out of the three cases named, the disappointments which
      resulted from continual defeat produced vices. Only my Uncle Obadiah, clad
      in his armor of unpierceable spuffle, rode through the ranks of life
      scatheless, with his sweetness unembittered and his integrity untarnished.
      But they were all good men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the June twilight we returned to the outskirts of London. We
      turned in at a ruined gateway, and rode through a tunnel of overhanging
      trees where laburnum blazed through the dusk. A long rambling house grew
      up before us. At one time it must have been the country estate of some
      city-merchant. At sound of our wheels on the gravel, the front-door opened
      and a little lady stepped out to greet us. She was neat and speckless as a
      hospital nurse. Her body was slim and dainty as a girl&rsquo;s. There was an air
      of decision and restraint about her, which was in direct opposition to my
      uncle&rsquo;s hurried geniality.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we had halted, she lifted me out of the dog-cart and carried me into
      the house to a large room at the back, which looked into a shadowy garden
      and a paddock beyond. It seemed older and more opulent than any house I
      had known as yet. There was so much space about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      My uncle came in from stabling Dollie. &ldquo;Well, Lavinia, I couldn&rsquo;t get home
      to lunch. Very sorry, but it couldn&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He darted a look across at me, wondering how much I had told her. The
      secret was established; I knew that I must hold my tongue. I knew
      something else&mdash;that he was afraid of her. Throughout the meal he
      kept up a stream of strenuous pretense, discussing large plans aloud with
      himself. What they were I cannot now remember. I suppose my grandmother
      would have called them spuffle. Suddenly he rose from the table, saying
      that he had a lot of letters to answer and excused himself. But when I
      went into his room an hour later to bid him good-night, he was sitting
      before his desk, doing nothing in particular, biting the end of his pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      When my aunt and I were left together I felt very lonely at first. She had
      sat so silent all through supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the door had closed, she turned to me laughing. I knew at once
      that, like most grown-ups when they are together, she had only been
      shamming. Now she was-going to be real.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you have a good day in the country?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Oh, he can&rsquo;t deceive
      me; I could tell by the dust on the wheels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, realizing, I suppose, that it was not fair to pump me, she stopped
      asking questions and began to speak about myself. She drew up a chair to
      the window and sat with me in the dark with her arms about me. She seemed
      extraordinarily young, and when her silky gray hair touched my cheek as
      she bent above me, I wondered what had made my uncle say that she wasn&rsquo;t
      like us and wouldn&rsquo;t understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      They each had their secret world of desire: his was the open road, where
      liberty was and lack of convention; hers was a home with fire-light and
      children. She was childless. Into both these worlds a little boy might
      enter. That night as I lay awake in bed I was puzzled. Why was it that
      grown people were so funny, and could never be real with one another?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV&mdash;RUTHITA
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was my Uncle
      Obadiah who first opened my eyes to the mysteries of the animal world. In
      so doing he flung wide a door into happiness which many a wiser man has
      neglected. He derived nearly all his pleasures from the cheerful little
      things of life. A curious sympathy existed between him and the lower
      creation. All the cats and dogs in the district were his friends. He
      attributed to them almost human personalities, and gave them special names
      of his own choosing. It was a wonderful day for me when he first made me
      realize that all-surrounding was a kingdom of beasts and birds of which I,
      who had always been ruled, might be ruler.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the paddock which lay between the garden and orchard, he had his own
      especial kingdom. His subjects were a cow, a goat, some very domestically
      inclined rabbits, about a hundred hens, and innumerable London sparrows.
      The latter he had trained to fly down from the trees and settle on his
      shoulders when he whistled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the morning we would go there together; the first duty of the day
      was to feed the menagerie. How distinctly I can recall those scenes&mdash;the
      dewy lawn, dappled golden by sunlight falling through leaves, the droning
      of bees setting forth from hives on their day&rsquo;s excursion, the smoke
      slowly rising in the summer stillness from distant chimney-pots, and my
      uncle&rsquo;s voice making excited guesses at how many eggs we should gather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eggs represented almost his sole contribution to the family income. Among
      his many Eldorados was the persistent belief that he could make his
      fortune at poultryraising. He would talk to me about it for hours as we
      worked in the garden, like a man inspired, making lightning calculations
      of the sums he would one day realize. He was continually experimenting and
      crossing breeds with a view to producing a more prolific strain of layers.
      He had a dream that one day he would produce the finest strain of fowl in
      the world. He would call it <i>The Spreckles</i> &mdash;his name would be
      immortalized. He would be justified in the eyes of Aunt Lavinia; and
      success would justify him in the eyes of all men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile my aunt declared that Obad spent more time and thought on that
      blest live-stock than he would ever see back in money. &ldquo;Obad&rdquo; was her
      contraction for his name; when she spoke to him sharply it sounded like
      her opinion of his character. But, in her own way, she was fond of him.
      Perhaps she had come to love his very failings as we do the faults of our
      friends. She was secretly proud of her own capacity; her thwarted
      mother-instinct found an outlet in the sense of his dependence.
      Nevertheless, the great fundamental cleavage lay between them: she lived
      in an anxious world where tradesmen&rsquo;s bills required punctual payment; his
      world was a careless playground in which no defeat was ever final. She was
      stable in her moods, self-reliant and tenaciously courageous. He was
      forever changing: with adults he was like a house in mourning, shuttered,
      austere, grave; but should a youngster pass by, the blinds were jerked
      aside and a laughing face peered out.
    </p>
    <p>
      His most important make-believe was that he was a benefactor of humanity.
      He held honorary positions of secretary to various philanthropic societies&mdash;<i>The
      Society for the Housing of Gipsies; The Society for the Assisting of
      Decrepit. Ladies</i>, etc. The positions were honorary because he could
      find no one willing to pay him. He worked for nothing because he was
      ashamed of being forever out of employment. He got great credit for his
      services among charitable people; the annual votes of thanks which he
      received helped to bolster up his self-respect throughout the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I grew older and more observant, I used to wonder what had induced my
      aunt to marry him. Again it was my Grandmother Cardover who told me, &ldquo;He
      spuffled Lavinia into it, my dear.&rdquo; It seems that he caught her by the
      vast commercial and humanitarian possibilities of one of his many plans.
      When she awoke to the fact that her husband was not a man, but the
      incarnation of perpetual boyhood, she may have been disappointed, but she
      did not show it. Like a sensible woman, instead of crying her eyes out,
      she set about earning a livelihood. Uncle Obad had one marketable asset&mdash;his
      religion and the friends he gained by it. She took a decayed mansion in
      Charity Grove and established a Christian Boarding House. All her lodgers
      were young men, and by that proud subterfuge of poverty they were known as
      paying-guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only Christian feature that I can remember about her establishment was
      that my uncle said grace before all meals at which the lodgers were
      present. At the midday meal, from which they were absent, it was omitted.
      The Christian Boarding House idea caught on with provincial parents whose
      sons were moving up to the city for the first time; it seemed to guarantee
      home morals. The sons soon perceived how matters stood and buried their
      agnostic prejudices beneath good feeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      A general atmosphere of obligation was created by my aunt in her husband&rsquo;s
      favor; she always spoke as though it was very kind of so public a man as
      Mr. Spreckles to squander his scanty privacy by letting paying-guests
      share his roof. She made such a gallant show with what she earned that
      everyone thought her husband had a private fortune, which enabled him to
      live in such style and give so much time to charitable works. She would
      hint as much in conversing with her friends, and invariably feigned the
      greatest pride and contentment in his activities. Thanks to his spuffling
      and her courage, there were not five people outside the family who ever
      guessed the true circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when all is said, the real business of my Uncle Obad&rsquo;s life was not
      philanthropy or running a boardinghouse, but poultry-raising. It was he
      who gave me the old white hen, without which I might never have met
      Ruthita. My money-making instincts were roused by his talk of the profits
      to be derived from eggs. I was enthusiastic to follow in his footsteps. To
      this end, at the hour of parting, when I was returning to Pope Lane, he
      gave me an ancient white Leghorn. He did not tell me she was ancient; he
      recommended her to me as belonging to a strain that could never get
      broody.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the long drive home across London, my grief at leaving Charity Grove
      was partly mitigated by my new possession. It was a tremendous experience
      to feel that I had it in my power to make a live thing, even though it
      were but a hen, sad or happy. I discussed with Uncle Obad all the care
      that was necessary for egg-production. I got him to work out sums for me.
      If my hen were to lay an egg every other day throughout the year, how much
      money would I make by selling each egg to my father at a penny? I felt
      that the foundations of my financial fortunes were secure. The genuineness
      of my expectations made my uncle restless and ashamed; he knew that the
      hen had passed her first youth, and suggested that pepper in her food
      might help matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was supper-time when I arrived home. I let the hen loose on the lawn to
      stretch her legs. My father was busy as usual, but he delayed a little
      longer over the meal in honor of my home-coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the things I blurted out about my uncle must have revealed to him
      the comradeship that lay between us. He had risen from the table, but he
      sat down again. &ldquo;You have known your uncle just a fortnight,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;and yet you seem to have told him more about yourself than you have told
      me in all these years. Why is it, Dante? You&rsquo;re not afraid of me? It can&rsquo;t
      be that.&rdquo; We were both of us shy. He reached over and took my hand,
      repeating, &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knew that it was that and so did I. Yet he was hungry for my affection.
      He was making an unaccustomed effort to win my confidence and draw me out.
      But he spoke to me as though I was a grown man, whereas my uncle to get
      near me had become himself a child. If he had only talked to me about my
      white hen, I should have chattered. But I was awed by his embarrassment,
      and remained silent and unresponsive.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on to tell me that all the time he was away from me in his study
      he was working for my sake. &ldquo;I want to have the money to give you a good
      start in life. I never had it. You must succeed where I have failed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I understood very little of what he was saying except that money and
      success seemed to be the same. That was the way Uncle Obad had talked
      about poultry-raising. I had no idea where money came from or how it was
      obtained. I must have asked him some question about it, for I recall one
      of the phrases he used in replying, &ldquo;A man succeeds not by what he does,
      but by the things at which he has aimed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The red sun fell behind the trees while we talked, peered above my
      father&rsquo;s shoulder, and sank out of sight. It was dusk when I ran into the
      garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt prisoned again&mdash;the door into the lane was locked and the
      walls were all about me. The lamp in my father&rsquo;s study was kindled and
      flung a bar of light across the shrubbery. He was working to get the money
      that I might be allowed to work. I didn&rsquo;t like the idea. I didn&rsquo;t want to
      work. Why couldn&rsquo;t one drive always through the sunshine, pulling up at
      taverns and sitting beside gipsy camp-fires?
    </p>
    <p>
      I commenced to search for the white hen and so forgot these economic
      complications. Here and there I came across places where she had been
      scrabbing, but I could see her nowhere. At last I discovered her roosting
      on the branch of an apple-tree which grew close by the wall at the end of
      the garden. I spoke to her kindly, but she refused to come down. She was
      too high up for me to reach her from the ground. When I scattered grain,
      she blinked at me knowingly, as much as to say, &ldquo;Surely you don&rsquo;t think
      I&rsquo;m as big a fool as that.&rdquo; It seemed to me that she was grieving for all
      the cocks and hens to whom she had said farewell. She was embittered
      against me because she was solitary. I explained to her that, if she&rsquo;d lay
      eggs, I&rsquo;d buy her a husband. She remained skeptical of my good intentions.
      There was nothing for it&mdash;but to climb. I could hear the leaves
      shaking and the apples bumping on the ground; my hand was stretched out to
      catch her when, with a hoarse scream of defiance, she flapped her wings
      and disappeared into the great nothingness over our neighbor&rsquo;s wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless the white hen had blazed the trail, I might have remained in the
      walled-in garden for years without ever daring to discover a way out. I
      was too excited at this crisis to measure my temerity. In my fear of
      losing her I did a thing undreamt of and unplanned&mdash;I swung myself
      from the branch on to the top of the brickwork and dropped on the other
      side. A bed of currant bushes broke my fall. I got upon my feet scratched
      and dazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing I saw was a long stretch of grass bordered by flowers. At
      the end of it was a small two-storied house, gabled and with verandas
      running round it. In one of the upper-story windows a light was burning;
      all the rest was in darkness. In the middle of the lawn I could see my
      white hen strutting in a very stately manner. I stole up behind her, but
      she began clucking. In my fear of discovery, I lost all patience and
      commenced to chase her vigorously. I ran her at last into a bed of peas,
      where she became entangled. I had her in my arms when I heard a voice,
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning suddenly, I found that a little girl was standing close behind me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Dante.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mine&rsquo;s Ruthita.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We stared at one another through the dusk. I had never spoken to a little
      girl and for some reason, difficult to explain, commenced to tremble. It
      was not fear that caused it, but something strong and emotional.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dante,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;How pretty!&rdquo; Then, &ldquo;Where do you live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I jerked my thumb in the direction of the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You climbed over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded. She laughed softly. &ldquo;Could you do it again? Oh, do come often,
      often. I&rsquo;m so lonely, and we could play together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the voice of Hetty began to call in the distance,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dan-tee, Dan-tee, where are you? Come to bed di-rectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice drew nearer. She was searching for me, and passed quite close to
      us on the other side of the wall. We could hear the indignant rustle of
      her skirt and her heavy breathing with bending down so low to peer under
      bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruthita came near to me so that I had my first glimpse of her eyes in the
      dark&mdash;eyes which were always to haunt me. Her hands were clasped
      against her throat in eagerness&mdash;she seemed to be standing tiptoe.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our secret. But come again to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched me scrambling for a foot-hold in the wall. When I sat astride
      it, just before I vanished, she waved her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The white hen had lost her importance in my thoughts;
    </p>
    <p>
      I bundled her into the tool-house, and then surrendered to Hetty. Hetty
      was very cross. She wanted to discover where I had been hiding, but I
      wouldn&rsquo;t tell her. When she left me, I crept out of bed and knelt beside
      the window for a long time gazing down into the blackness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far away a bird was calling. The tall trees waved their arms. The moon
      leapt out of clouds, and the branches reached up to touch her with their
      fingers. A little beam of light struggled free and ran about the garden. I
      tried to tell myself it was Ruthita.
    </p>
    <p>
      The garden seemed less of a prison now&mdash;rather a place of magic and
      enchantment.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V&mdash;MARRIAGE ACCORDING TO HETTY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>ext morning I was
      up early. Spiders&rsquo; webs were still crystal with dew in the garden; they
      had not yet been tattered by the sun lifting up the flowers&rsquo; heads. I had
      no hope that I would see Ruthita, but I wanted to peep across the wall
      while everyone was in bed and there was no one to observe me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had covered half the distance to the apple-tree, when I heard a sound of
      voices. They came from behind the tool-house. I fisted my hands and
      listened. A man and woman were conversing, but in such low tones that I
      could hear nothing that was said. I made sure they were thieves who had
      heard about my hen, and had come to rob me. I looked back at the windows
      of our house. All the blinds were lowered; everyone was sleeping. There
      was no sign of life anywhere, save the hopping of early risen blackbirds
      between bushes in search of early risen worms. With a quickly beating
      heart I crouched beside the wall, advancing under cover of a row of
      sunflowers. Looking out from between their stalks, I discovered a man
      sitting on a wheelbarrow; a woman was balanced on his knee with her arm
      about his neck. The woman was Hetty and the man was our gardener.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetty was wearing her starched print-dress, ready to begin her morning&rsquo;s
      work. She wasn&rsquo;t a bit scornful or solemn, but was laughing and wriggling
      and tossing her head. She seemed quite a different person from the stern,
      moral housemaid, God&rsquo;s intimate friend, who told me everything that God
      had thought about me through the day when at night she was putting me to
      bed. Up to that moment it had never occurred to me that she was pretty,
      but now her cheeks were flushed and the sun was in her rumpled hair. While
      I watched, our gardener drew her close and kissed her. She squeaked like a
      little mouse, and pretended to struggle to free herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never dreamt that grown people ever behaved like that. I hadn&rsquo;t the
      faintest notion what she was doing or why she was doing it; but I knew
      that it was something secret, and silly, and beautiful. I also had the
      feeling that it was something pleasant and wrong, just like the things I
      most enjoyed doing, for which I was punished. I wanted to withdraw and
      tried to; but tripped over the sunflowers and fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetty and the gardener sprang apart. I knew what was going to happen next;
      I had caught them being natural&mdash;they were going to commence
      shamming. The gardener became very busy, piling his tools into the barrow.
      Hetty, talking in her cold and distant manner, said to him, &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t
      forget the lettuce for breakfast, John. Master&rsquo;s very partic&rsquo;lar about
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I came from my hiding, thrusting my hands deep in my pockets, as though I
      kept my courage there and was frightened of its dropping out. The
      gardener&rsquo;s back was towards me, but he caught sight of me from between his
      legs. He just stopped like that with his face growing redder, his mouth
      wide-open, and stared. Hetty didn&rsquo;t look as pretty as she had been
      looking, but before she could say anything I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t
      mean to. I came to see my fowl&mdash;&mdash; but I won&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless &rsquo;is little &rsquo;eart,&rdquo; cried John; &ldquo;I thought it were &rsquo;is
      Pa, I wuz that scared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hetty knelt down beside me and rocked me to and fro half-hysterically,
      making me promise again and again that I would never tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was you doin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; wrong?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;What was you doin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked foolishly at one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that day they kept me near them on one pretext or another, afraid to
      let me get away from them. I had never known them so sensible and
      obliging; they did all kinds of things for me that they had never done
      before. After breakfast, while Hetty was dusting, John built me a little
      fowl-run. In the afternoon, while he was cutting the grass, Hetty sat with
      me beneath the apple-tree and told me what life meant. She spoke in
      whispers like a conspirator, and all the time that she was talking, I
      could hear Ruthita humming just the other side of the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I understood it, this was what she told me. When: you first get here,
      <i>here</i> being the world, you own nothing; and know nothing. Then, as
      you grow up, you know something but still own nothing. That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re
      ordered about and told not to do all the things that you want most to do.
      You can only please yourself when nobody&rsquo;s looking and must obey nearly
      everyone until you get money. There are several ways of getting it, and
      the pleasantest is sweet-hearting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I interrupted her to inquire what was sweet-hearting. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she
      said, turning her face away and looking dreamily at John, who was pushing
      the mower across the lawn, &ldquo;sweet-heartin&rsquo;s what you saw me and John
      doin&rsquo;.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it always have to be done before breakfast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw back her head and laughed, swaying backwards and forwards. Then
      she became solemn and answered, &ldquo;I &rsquo;ave to do it before breakfast
      &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m a servant. But I does it of evenin&rsquo;s on my night out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went on to tell me that sweet-hearting was the first step towards
      freedom and money. The second step was a. honeymoon, which consisted in
      going away with a person of the other sex for a week to some place where
      you weren&rsquo;t known. When you came back to the people who knew you, they
      said you were married. So marriage was the third and last step. After that
      you were given a house, and money, and all the things for which you had
      always yearned. You had other people, who were like you were before you
      went sweet-hearting, to take your orders, and run your errands, and say
      &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; or &ldquo;Madam.&rdquo; Sometimes when you came back from your honeymoon, you
      found children in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      So through that long summer&rsquo;s afternoon beneath the apple-tree, with the
      leaves gently stirring and the sound of Ruthita humming across the wall, I
      gained my first lesson in sexology and domestic economics. It solved a
      good many problems by which I had been puzzled. For instance, why Uncle
      Obad had a pony and I hadn&rsquo;t; why I was sent to bed always at the same
      hour and my father went only when he chose; why big people could lose
      their tempers without being wicked, whereas God was always angry when I
      did it. There was only one thing that I couldn&rsquo;t understand: why two boys
      couldn&rsquo;t go on a honeymoon together, or two girls, and have the same
      results follow. Except for this, the riddle of society was now solved as
      far as I was concerned. Marriage seemed a thousand times more wonderful
      than the magic carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was tremendously interested in the possibilities of sweet-hearting and
      promised to help Hetty all I could. In return she declared that, when she
      was married, she would persuade my father to let her take me out of the
      garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening I crept over the wall and found Ruthita waiting. She was a
      slim dainty little figure, clad in a short white dress. She had great gray
      eyes, and long black hair and lashes. Her voice was soft and caressing,
      like the twittering of a bird in the ivy when one wakens on a summer
      morning. I told her in hurried whispers what I had discovered. It was all
      news to her. She slipped her hand into mine while I spoke and nestled
      closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little boy,&rdquo; she whispered when I had ended, &ldquo;you <i>are</i> funny! You
      come climbing over the garden-wall and you tell me everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An old man came out of the house and began to pace up and down the walks.
      His head was bent forward on his chest and he had a big red scar on his
      forehead. A cloak hung loosely from his shoulders. He carried a stick in
      his hand on which he leant heavily. Ruthita said he was her grandfather.
      Soon he began to call for her, and she had to go to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little I learnt her story. Her grandfather was a French general.
      He had fought in the Franco-Prussian War until the Fall of the Empire and
      Proclamation of the Republic. Shortly after the flight of the Empress
      Eugénie he had come to England in disgust. His son, Ruthita&rsquo;s father, had
      stayed behind and been cut to pieces in the Siege of Paris. Ruthita&rsquo;s
      mother was an Englishwoman. She had never recovered from the shock of her
      husband&rsquo;s death. It was her light that I saw burning in the bedroom window
      of evenings. They were almost poor now and lived in great seclusion. The
      grandfather had dropped his rank and was known as plain Monsieur Favart.
      So Ruthita was even a closer prisoner than myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did we talk about in those first stolen hours of&rsquo; childish
      friendship? I asked her once when we were grown up, but she could not tell
      me. Perhaps we did not say much. We felt together&mdash;felt the mystery
      of the enchanted unseen world. Why, the pigeons strutting on the housetops
      had seen more than we had; and they were not half as old as we were! They
      spread their wings, soared up into the clouds, and vanished. We told one
      another stories of where they went; but long before the stories were ended
      Monsieur Favart would come searching for Ruthita or the voice of Hetty
      would ring through the dusk, calling me to bed. Then I would lie awake and
      imagine myself a pigeon, and finish the story to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great beauty of our meetings was that they were undiscovered. It was
      always I who went to Ruthita&mdash;she was nothing of a climber, and the
      red bricks and green moss would have left tell-tale marks upon her dress.
      We had a nest of straw behind the currant bushes. Here, with backs against
      the hard wall and fingers digging in the cool damp earth, we would sit and
      wonder, talking in whispers, of all the mysteries that lay before us.
      Ruthita had vague memories of Paris, of soldiers marching and the beating
      of drums. Sometimes she would sing French songs to me, of which she would
      translate the meaning between each verse. My contribution to our little
      store of knowledge was limited to what I have written in these few
      chapters.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t know at what stage in the proceedings our great idea occurred. It
      must have been in the early autumn, for the evenings were drawing in and
      often it was chilly. I had been talking about Hetty, when suddenly I
      exclaimed, &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; she questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get married!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I reminded her of the extreme simplicity of marriage as explained by
      our housemaid. All we had to do was to slip out of the garden for a few
      days, and then come back. We should find a house ready for us. Perhaps I
      should have a pony like Uncle Obad, and, instead of dolls, Ruthita would
      have real babies. It was the real babies that caught her fancy. Because of
      her mother, she needed a little persuading. &ldquo;What will she do wivout me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what would she do if you&rsquo;d never been borned?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruthita had five shillings in her money-box. I had only a shilling; for
      the white hen, in spite of pepper, had failed to lay any eggs. Six
      shillings seemed to us a fortune&mdash;ample to provide for the honeymoon
      of two small children.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gate from Monsieur Favart&rsquo;s garden was never locked: that was
      evidently our easiest way out.

      CHAPTER VI&mdash;THE YONDER LAND
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hat did we hope to
      find that autumn morning when we slipped through that narrow door,
      forsaking the walls? It was all a guess to us&mdash;what lay beyond; but
      we knew that it must be something splendid. Of one thing we were quite
      certain: that at the end of a few days we should have grown tall; we
      should return to Pope Lane a man and woman. The little house would be
      there waiting, magically built in our hours of absence. Perhaps work had
      been begun already upon the babies that Ruthita wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time I had kissed her that morning, awkwardly and shyly,
      feeling that somehow it was proper. At any rate, Hetty and our gardener
      always kissed when they got the chance and no one was looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Favart&rsquo;s door swung to behind us. We ran as quickly as our legs
      would carry us. The fear of pursuit was upon us. Pinned to the pillow of
      each of our empty beds was a sheet of paper on which was scrawled, &ldquo;<i>Gon
      to git Maried,&rdquo;.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last we halted for breath, we seemed to have covered many miles of
      our journey. We were standing in a long, quaint street. On one side flowed
      a river, railed in so we couldn&rsquo;t get near it. On the other side stood an
      irregular row of substantial houses, for the most part creeper-covered. No
      faces appeared in the houses&rsquo; windows. No one passed up or down the
      street. It was as yet too early. It seemed that the world was empty, and
      that we and the birds were its only tenants. We turned to the right,
      half-walking, half-running. I held Ruthita&rsquo;s hand tightly; the feel of it
      gave me courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must have made a queer pair in the mellow autumn sunlight. Ruthita wore
      a white dress with a red cloak flung over it. On her head was a yellow
      straw poke-bonnet, which made her face look strangely small. She had on
      black shoes, fastened by a single strap, and black and white socks which,
      when she ran, kept dropping.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had no idea of direction, but just hurried on with a vague idea that we
      must keep moving forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently we came across a drover, driving a flock of bewildered, tired
      sheep. He was a lame man. He had an inflamed red face and one of his eyes
      was out. When he wanted to make his flock move faster, he jabbed viciously
      at their tails with a pointed stick and started hopping from side to side,
      barking like a dog. He passed right by us, saying nothing, waving a red
      flag in his left hand with which he would sometimes mop his forehead. We
      followed. We followed him through streets of shops all shuttered; we
      followed him up a broad-paved hill; we followed him down a winding lane to
      a bridge across a river, beyond which lay marshes. Then he turned and
      called to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little master, where be you goin&rsquo; and why be you followin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the country, I told him, to find the forest. I wanted to show Ruthita
      the unwalled garden through which my uncle had led me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man screwed up his one eye, and gazed upon us shrewdly. &ldquo;You be wery
      small to be goin&rsquo; to the forest. But so be you&rsquo;re travellin&rsquo; along my
      route you might as well &rsquo;elp an old feller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We made our bargain with him. We would help him with his sheep, if he
      would guide us to the forest. We ran beside him across the short, crisp
      grass, imitating his cries to prevent the sheep from scattering. He told
      us that he had driven them from Epping up to London, but that times were
      cruel bad and the farmer who employed him had been unable to sell them.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cruel &rsquo;ard on a man o&rsquo; my years,&rdquo; he kept saying, &ldquo;cruel &rsquo;ard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I asked him what was cruel hard, he shook his-head as though language
      failed to express his wrongs: &ldquo;The world in gineral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was one of the sheep whose leg was broken. It kept lagging behind
      the rest, which made the man jab at it furiously. Ruthita&rsquo;s eyes filled
      with tears of indignation when she saw it. She stamped her little foot and
      insisted that he should not do it. The man pushed back his battered hat
      and scratched his forehead, staring at her. He seemed embarrassed and
      tried to excuse himself. &ldquo;Humans is humans, miss, and sheep is sheep. It
      makes an old chap, made in Gawd&rsquo;s h&rsquo;image, kind o&rsquo; bitter to &rsquo;ave
      to spend his days a-scampering after a crowd o&rsquo; silly quadrupeds. But if
      yer don&rsquo;t like it, I won&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The river wound round about us. Sometimes it would leave us, but always it
      came flowing after us, in great circles as though lonely and eager for our
      company. On its banks stood occasional taverns, gaily painted, with wooden
      tables set before them. The grass about them was trodden bare, showing
      that they were often populous; but now they were deserted. Big barges lay
      sleepily at anchor, basking in the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drover commenced speaking again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an old soldier, I am. I lost me
      eye and got lamed in the wars; and now they makes game o&rsquo; my h&rsquo;infirmities
      and calls me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The name they called him was evidently too dreadful. He sighed heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor man,&rdquo; said Ruthita, slipping her hand into his horny palm. &ldquo;What do
      they call you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old-Dot-and-Carry-One, &rsquo;cause o&rsquo; the way I walks. It&rsquo;s woundin&rsquo;.
      It &rsquo;urts me feelin&rsquo;s, after the way I&rsquo;ve served me country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We seated ourselves by the muddy river-bank, while the sheep grazed and
      rested. Far in the distance trees broke the level of the sky-line, so I
      knew that we were going in the right direction and our guide was to be
      trusted. Dot-and-Carry-One produced a loaf of bread from his pocket and,
      dividing it into three pieces, shared it with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little he gave us his confidence, telling us of the world as he
      knew it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a place o&rsquo; wimen and war. To the h&rsquo;eye wot&rsquo;s prejoodiced
      there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; else in it. But your h&rsquo;eye ain&rsquo;t prejoodiced, and don&rsquo;t
      yer never let it git so, young miss and master. I&rsquo;ve seen lots. I wuz in
      the Crimea and I wuz in h&rsquo;India, but I never yet seen the country where a
      man can&rsquo;t be &rsquo;appy if he wants. There&rsquo;s music, an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s nature,
      an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s marriage. Now music for h&rsquo;instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He produced from his ragged coat a penny whistle and trilled out a tune
      upon it. While he played he looked as merry a fellow as one could hope to
      meet in a day&rsquo;s march. The sheep stopped cropping to gaze at us. We
      clapped our hands and asked him to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head and replaced his pipe. &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s nature. Just now I
      wuz complainin&rsquo;. But supposin&rsquo; I do drive sheep back and forth, how many
      men wuz up in Lun&rsquo;non to see the sunrise this mornin&rsquo;? I never miss it, &rsquo;ceptin&rsquo;
      when I&rsquo;m drunk. I knows the seasons o&rsquo; the bloomin&rsquo; flowers, Gawd bless &rsquo;em,
      and can h&rsquo;imitate the birds&rsquo; songs and call &rsquo;em to me. That&rsquo;s
      somethin&rsquo;. An&rsquo; if I don&rsquo;t sleep in a stuffy bed, which would be better,
      for me rheumatics, I can count the stars and have the grass for coverin&rsquo;.
      And then there&rsquo;s marriage&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused. His eye became moist and his face gentle. &ldquo;I &rsquo;ad a
      little nipper and a girl once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was all. We wanted to ask him questions about marriage, but he pulled
      his hat down over his eyes and lay back, refusing to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruthita and I guarded the sheep and kept them from straying, while he
      slept. We made chains out of flowers, and, taking off our shoes and socks,
      paddled in the water. Then Ruthita grew tired and, leaning against my
      shoulder, persuaded me to tell her the story of where we were going.
      Before the tale was ended, her eyes were closed and her lips were parted.
      My arms began to ache terribly; I wondered whether it was with holding her
      or because I was growing. I hoped it was because I was growing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dot-and-Carry-One woke up. He looked at the sun. &ldquo;Time we wuz h&rsquo;orf,&rdquo; he
      remarked shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had not gone far along the river-bank when we came to a tavern on our
      side of the water. Ruthita said that she was thirsty, so we entered. The
      drover spread himself out on a bench and, soliciting my invitation, called
      for &ldquo;a pint of strong.&rdquo; Good beer, he said, never hurt any man if taken in
      moderation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must have sat for the best part of the morning, watching him toss off
      pot after pot while we gritted our feet on the sanded floor. For each pot
      he thanked us, taking off his battered hat to Ruthita and blowing away the
      froth from the top in our honor. He explained to all and sundry that we
      wuz his little nipper and girl wot he had losht. He losht us years ago, so
      long he could hardly remember. The tavern-girl entered into a discussion
      with him, saying that we could not be more than nine and that he was at
      least seventy. He became angry, demanding whether a man of seventy hadn&rsquo;t
      lived long enough to know his own children, and what bloody indifference
      it made to her, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to me that it might be just possible that he really was
      Ruthita&rsquo;s father. I had no idea what dying meant. I had been told that the
      dead were not really dead&mdash;only gone. So I thought that death might
      mean not being with your friends in the garden. I half expected to find my
      mother in the forest, just as I had hoped to bring her back on the magic
      carpet. So when Dot-and-Carry-One was so positive, I asked him if he had
      heard of the Siege of Paris. He was in a mood when he had heard of
      everything, been everywhere, and had had every important person for a
      friend. Of course he had heard of the Siege of Paris; if it hadn&rsquo;t been
      for him, to-day there wouldn&rsquo;t be any Paris. When I told him of General
      Favart, he wept copiously and called for another pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tavern-girl told him that that must be his last, and he said that it
      was cruel &rsquo;ard the way an old soldier were persecooted. When we had
      paid for his drinks, we discovered that we had only three shillings and
      eightpence left of our little stock of money. The tavern-girl said we were
      poor h&rsquo;innercent lambs and she should set the police on him. The drover
      told her that spring, not autumn, was the lambing season.
    </p>
    <p>
      All through the long and drowsy afternoon we wandered on.
      Dot-and-Carry-One seemed in no great hurry to reach his destination. Beer
      had had a transfiguring effect upon him. He lurched along jauntily, his
      hat cocked sideways on his head, winking with his one good eye at any
      girls we met in our path. His cares and sense of injustice were forgotten.
      He told us tales of his wars, painting tremendous and bloody scenes of
      carnage. He slew whole armies that afternoon, and at the end of each
      battle he was left alone, wounded but dauntless, with the dead &rsquo;uns
      piled high about him. He went into grisly details of the manner of their
      dying, and stopped now and then to show us with his stick the different
      ways in which you could kill a man with a sword. Cockney lovers on the
      river gaped after us, resting on their oars. They saw nothing but an
      intoxicated old ruffian in charge of a flock of sheep and two small
      children. But we were in hero-land, and Dot-and-Carry-One was our
      giant-killer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ruthita got tired, he hoisted her on to his shoulders, where she rode
      straddling his neck, with her hands clasped about his forehead. The
      forest, like a green silent army, with its flags unfurled marched nearer.
      The sun sank lower behind us; our long lean shadows ran on before us till
      they lay across the backs of the sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      We left the marshes and entered on a white dusty road. Carriages and
      coaches and wagons kept passing, which made the sheep bewildered. They
      kept turning this way and that, bleating pitifully. Ruthita had to walk
      again, while Dot-and-Carry-One barked and waved his stick to keep the
      flock from scattering. The night came on and we were hungry. At last
      Ruthita&rsquo;s legs gave out and she sat down by the roadside crying, saying
      that she was frightened and could go no further. Then Dot-and-Carry-One
      drove his flock into the forest, and borrowed a shilling from me and left
      us, promising to go and buy food with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sheep lay down about the roots of the trees, and we pillowed our heads
      against their woolly backs. The silence became intense; the last of the
      twilight vanished. I was glad when Ruthita put her arms round my neck, for
      I too was nervous though I would not own it. We waited for the drover to
      return, and in waiting slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      I woke with a start. The moon was shining; long paths of silver had been
      hewn between the trees. The fleece of the kneeling sheep was sparkling and
      dewy. Far down one of the paths I could see a limping figure approaching.
      He was shouting and singing and stabbing at his shadow. As he came nearer
      I could distinctly see that he held a bottle in his hand. Something warned
      me. I roused Ruthita, telling her to make no sound. We ran till we were
      breathless and the shouting could be no more heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trees grew wider apart where we had halted. Far away a flare of light
      shone up; as we watched we saw that people passed before it. Hand-in-hand
      we advanced. Something groaned quite near us. We commenced to run, but,
      looking back, saw that it was only a tethered donkey. We came to the
      outskirts of the crowd. We wanted company badly. Burrowing under arms and
      legs we made our way to the front. A great linen sheet was stretched
      between two trees. Set up on iron rings before it was a line of cocoanuts.
      On either side flaring naphtha-lamps were burning. About thirty yards away
      from the sheet a woman was serving out wooden balls. Between the sheet and
      the cocoanuts a man was darting up and down, dodging the balls as they
      were thrown and returning them. The man and woman were calling out
      together, &ldquo;Two shies a penny. Two shies a penny. Every ball &rsquo;its a
      cocoanut. Down she goes. &rsquo;Ere you are, sir. Two for the children
      and one for the missis. Walk up. Walk up. Two shies a penny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether a cocoanut went down or stayed up, they continued to assert in a
      hoarse, cracked monotone that it had fallen. Their faces were dripping
      with perspiration. The man returned the balls and the woman served them
      out again mechanically. The throwers took off their coats and hurled
      furiously, to the accompaniment of the shrill staccato chatter of the
      crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruthita and I stood blinking in the semi-darkness, our eyes dazzled by the
      lamps. Suddenly I called out, and pushing my way between the throwers,
      commenced running up the pitch. The man behind the cocoanuts, realizing
      that the balls had ceased coming, stopped dodging and looked up to see
      what was the matter. Just then an impatient thrower hurled a ball which
      went whizzing over me, missed the cocoanuts, and hit the man on the head,
      splitting his eyebrow. I was terribly afraid that he would topple over and
      lie still, like Dot-and-Carry-One had told me men did in battle. Instead
      of that, when I came within reach of him he clutched me angrily by the
      shoulder, asking me what the devil I meant. The blood, creeping down his
      face in a slow trickle, made him look twice as fierce as when I had first
      met him with my Uncle Obad by the gipsy campfire. He drew me near to one
      of the lamps, smearing his forehead with the back of his hand. He
      recognized me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, you young cuss, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the fortune-telling girl came up, whom I had seen before with
      the baby on her back. She was carrying Ruthita.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Lilith,&rdquo; he said, speaking gruffly, &ldquo;take &rsquo;im to your tent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he commenced again, &ldquo;Two shies a penny. Two shies a penny. Every ball
      &rsquo;its a cocoanut. Down she goes,&rdquo; etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was glad to creep into the cool darkness, clinging close to Lilith&rsquo;s
      skirt. I was a little boy now, with scarcely a desire to be a husband.
      When I looked across my shoulder the game was in full swing. The woman was
      serving out the balls; the crowd was paying its pennies; the man was
      dodging up and down before the sheet, avoiding the balls and returning
      them. I heaved a sigh of relief; then he had not succumbed&mdash;he was
      not yet a dead&rsquo;un.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII&mdash;THE OPEN WORLD
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hat night in the
      tent I slept soundly, with the fortuneteller&rsquo;s arm about me and my head
      nearly touching Ruthita&rsquo;s across her breast. The soft rise and fall of her
      bosom made me dream of my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glimmerings of the early autumn sunrise crept in through holes in the
      canvas. I raised myself cautiously and gazed at the woman who had cared
      for me. I call her a woman, for she seemed to me a woman then; she was
      about seventeen&mdash;little more than a girl. Her face was gentle and
      passionate; her jet black hair streamed down in a torrent across her tawny
      throat and breast. She smiled in her sleep and murmured to herself; the
      arm which clasped Ruthita kept twitching, as though to draw her nearer.
      While I watched, her eyes opened; she said nothing, but lay smiling up at
      me. Presently she put her free arm about my neck, and drew me down so my
      cheek rested against hers. She turned her head and I saw that, though she
      looked happy, there were tears on her long dark lashes. Her lips moved and
      I knew what she wanted. Putting my arms about her, I kissed her
      good-morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rousing Ruthita, she raised the flap of the tent and we slipped out. Mists
      were drifting across the woodland, pink and golden where the sunrise
      caught them, but lavender in the shadows. It was a quiet fairy world, like
      the face of a sleeping woman, which was pale with dew upon the forehead
      and copper and bronze with the streaming hair of faded foliage. Outside
      the door the grass was blackened in a circle where a gipsy fire had burnt.
      The yellow caravan stood near. In and out the bracken rabbits were
      hopping, nibbling at the cool green turf. The gipsy&rsquo;s lurcher watched
      them, crouched with his nose between his paws, waiting his opportunity to
      steal closer. Lilith set about gathering brushwood for the fire and we
      helped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruthie, am I taller?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She eyed me judicially and shook her curls. &ldquo;No. But p&rsquo;raps we shall grow
      tall quite suddenly, when the honeymoon is ended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was beginning to have my doubts of that, so I changed the subject.
      &ldquo;Lilith has a baby. She carries it on her back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does she keep it now?&rdquo; asked Ruthita. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t on her back last
      night in the tent.&rdquo; Then she commenced to hop about like an eager, excited
      little bird. &ldquo;I shall ask her. I shall ask her, Dante, and she&rsquo;ll let me
      hold it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when we ran to Lilith her back was straight and unbulgy. And when we
      asked her where she kept the baby, she dropped the bundle of sticks she
      was carrying and sank to her knees, with her hands pressed against her
      breast. She swayed to and fro, with her eyes closed, muttering in a
      strange language. Then she bent forward, kissing the ground and chanting
      words which sounded like, &ldquo;Coroon! Coroon! Oh, dearie, come back. Come
      back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We heard the door of the caravan open. Lilith sprang to her feet and
      picked up her sticks as though ashamed of what she had been doing. The
      fierce man stood on the caravan steps. He strode across the grass to
      Lilith and laid his hand on her shoulder with a rough gesture which was
      almost kindly. &ldquo;The wind blows, sister,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and it sinks behind the
      moon. The flowers grow, sister, and they fall beneath the earth. Where
      they have gone there is rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He passed on, whistling to his lurcher. The gaudily dressed woman came
      out; while he was gone, the fire was kindled and breakfast was prepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      During breakfast a great discussion arose in their strange language. When
      it was ended, Lilith took us with her into the tent. She closed the flap
      carefully and began to undress us. While she was doing it she explained
      matters. She told us that the man was too busy just now with the
      cocoa-nut-shies to spare time to go and fetch my uncle to us. In a few
      days he would go, but meanwhile we must stay with them in camp. She said
      that they were good gipsies, but no one would believe it if they saw us
      with them. They would have to make us like gipsy children so no one would
      suspect. So she daubed our bodies all over a light brown color, and she
      stained my hair because it was flaxen. Then she gave us ragged clothes,
      without shoes or stockings, and dug a hole in the ground and hid ours. She
      was curious to know what had brought us to the forest; but we would not
      tell. We had the child&rsquo;s feeling that telling a grown-up would break the
      spell&mdash;we should never be married then, the little house would never
      be built, and none of the other pleasant things would happen. We should
      have to go back to the garden again and live always within walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those days spent in our first dash for freedom stand out in my memory as
      among the happiest. I ate of the forbidden fruit of romance and reaped no
      penalties. Ruth-ita cried at times for her mother; but I had only to
      remind her of the babies, she would have, and her courage returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smell of the camp-fire is in my nostrils as I write; I can feel again
      the cool nakedness of unpaved woodlands beneath my feet and open skies
      above my head. I see Ruthita unsubdued and bare-legged, plunging
      shoulder-high into golden bracken, shouting with natural gladness,
      followed by the gipsy boys and girls. We tasted life in its fullness for
      the first time, she and I, on that fantastic honeymoon of ours. We felt in
      our bones and flesh the simple ecstasy of being alive&mdash;the wide,
      sweet cleanness of the open world. And remembering, I wonder now, as I
      wondered then, why men have toiled to learn everything except to be happy,
      and have labored with so much heaviness to build cities when the tent and
      the camp-fire might be theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Books, schoolmasters, and universities have taught me much since then.
      They have spattered the windows of my soul with knowledge to prevent my
      looking out. Luckily I discovered what they were doing and stopped the
      rascals. But I knew more things that were essentially godlike before they
      commenced their work. The major part of what they taught me was a
      weariness to the flesh in the learning, and a burden to the brain when
      learnt. Of how many days of shouting and sunshine they robbed me with
      their mistaken kindness. Of what worth is a Euclid problem at forty, when
      compared with the memory of a childhood&rsquo;s day of flowers, and meadows, and
      happiness?
    </p>
    <p>
      For twenty years my father sat prisoner at a desk, unbeautifully and
      doggedly driving his pen across countless pages that he might be able to
      buy me wisdom. With all his years of sacrifice and my years of laborious
      study, he gave me nothing which was half so valuable as that which a boy
      of nine stole for himself in his ignorance in the forest. There I learnt
      that the sound of wind in trees is the finest music in the world; that the
      power to feel in one&rsquo;s own body the wholesome beauties of nature is more
      rewarding than wealth; that to know how to abandon oneself to the simple
      kindness of living people is a wiser knowledge than all the elaborate and
      codified wisdom of the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      We roamed the countryside with Lilith by day, listening to her telling
      fortunes. By night we slept in her arms in the tent. Only one thing was
      forbidden us&mdash;to speak with strangers. But there was one man who
      recognized us in spite of that. It was on the first morning. We were
      sitting by the side of the road with the fierce man; he was showing us how
      to make a snare for a rabbit. We were so interested that we did not notice
      a flock of sheep approaching until they were quite close. Then I looked up
      and caught the eye of old Dot-and-Carry One burning in his head, glaring
      out at us as if it would fly from its socket. He would have spoken had he
      dared, but just then the fierce man saw him. He sank his chin upon his
      breast and, for all that he was &ldquo;a human, made in Gawd&rsquo;s h&rsquo;image,&rdquo; limped
      away into the distance in a cloud of dust, as meekly sheepish as any of
      the sheep he followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruthita spent a lot of her time in searching for Lilith&rsquo;s baby. She wanted
      so badly to hold it. We felt quite certain that she had hidden it
      somewhere, as she had our clothes. Even if it was a dead&rsquo;un, it was absurd
      to suppose that a person so clever as to tell fortunes should not know
      where it might be found. We determined to watch her. We thought that if
      her baby was really dead and she went to it by stealth, then by following
      her we should be able to find my mother and, perhaps, Ruthita&rsquo;s father.
      Ruthita had already abandoned the dread that Dot-and-Carry-One had had
      anything to do with her entrance into the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naphtha-lamps were extinguished. The crowd of merrymakers had departed. I
      was roused by Lilith stirring. Very gently she eased her arm from under
      me. I kept my eyes tightly shut and feigned that I was undisturbed.
      Cautiously she pulled aside the flap of the tent and stole out. I rose to
      my feet when she had gone. Ruthita was sleeping soundly, her small face
      cushioned in her hand. Without waking her I followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near to the caravan the camp-fire smoldered, making a splash of red like a
      pool of blood in the blackness. As I watched, it was momentarily blotted
      out by a moving shadow. The lurcher shook himself and growled. Lilith&rsquo;s
      voice reached me, telling him to lie down. A bank of cloud lay across the
      moon, but I knew the way she went by the rustle of the fallen leaves,
      turning beneath her tread. I followed her down the glades of the forest,
      peering after her, glancing behind me at the slightest sound, timid lest I
      might lose her, timid lest I might lose myself, stealing on tiptoe into
      the unknown with sobbing, stifled breath. The ground began to descend into
      a hollow at the bottom of which a pond lay black and sullen. A tall beech
      stood at its edge, spreading out its branches and leaning across it as if
      to hide it. The leaves beneath her footsteps ceased to stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I could no longer hear her, a horrible, choking sense of solitude
      took hold of me. What if she had entered into the tree and should never
      return? Without her, how should I find my way back? I crept as near the
      pond as I dared, and crouched among the dead leaves, trembling. The water
      began to splash. &ldquo;Someone,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;is rising out of it.&rdquo; Little
      waves, washing in the rushes, caused the brittle reeds to shake and
      shiver, whispering in terror among themselves. A low sing-song muttering
      commenced. It came from the middle of the pond. I tried to stop breathing.
      It seemed quite possible that the baby was hidden there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bank of cloud trailed across the sky. The yellow harvest moon dipped,
      broad and smiling, into the latticework of boughs which roofed the dell.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the pond, knee-deep, Lilith stood. She had cast aside her
      Romany rags and rose from the water tall and splendid. Her tawny body was
      a gold statue glistening beneath the moon. Her night-black hair fell sheer
      from her shoulders like a silken shadow. She was bending forward, peering
      eagerly beneath the water&rsquo;s surface, whispering hurried love-words. Of all
      that she said I could only catch the words, &ldquo;Coroon. Coroon. Come back,
      little dearest. Come back.&rdquo; She laughed gladly and held out her arms, as
      though there drifted up towards her that which she sought. I could see
      nothing, for her back was towards me. Still lower she bent till her lips
      kissed the water&rsquo;s surface; plunging her arms in elbow-deep, she seemed to
      support the thing which she saw there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lilith, oh Lilith!&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started and turned. I feared she was going to be angry. &ldquo;Show me my
      Mama,&rdquo; I whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her finger to her lips, and beckoned, and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hastily I undressed, tossing my rags beside hers. I waded out to where she
      was standing. The night air was chilly. She gave me her hand and drew me
      to her. Placing me before her, so that I could gaze into the pond like a
      mirror, she chanted over and over a low, wild tune. She peered above my
      shoulders. At first I could see only my own reflection and hers. Then, as
      she sang, the water moved, the inky blackness reddened; I forgot
      everything, the cold, Lilith, my terror, and lived only in that which was
      coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the bottom of the pool, infinitely distant, a picture grew. It came so
      near that I thought it would touch me; I became a part of it. I saw my
      mother. She was seated by a fire in an unlighted room. A little boy lay in
      her lap with his arms about her. She glanced up at me smiling faintly,
      gazing into my eyes directly. For a moment I saw her distinctly, and
      caught again the fragrance of violets that clung about her. The water
      rippled and the vision died away in smoke and cloud. Lilith gathered me to
      her cold wet breast and carried me to the shore and dressed me. Without
      knowing why, I knew that this was a happening that I must not tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      We returned to camp. Woods were stirring. Shadows were thinning. Dawn was
      breaking. The coldness in the air became intense. We threw branches on the
      fire and blew the smoldering embers, till sparks began to fly and twigs to
      crackle. Lilith sat with me in her arms, and hushed and mothered me. I was
      not ashamed; for five years I had wanted just that. I was glad that she
      understood. Ruthita could not see me; nobody but the dawn would ever know.
      So I fell asleep and went back to the fragrance of violets, the fire, and
      the cosy darkened room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII&mdash;RECAPTURED
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span> uthita and I were
      terribly puzzled about that baby. We couldn&rsquo;t make out how it had found
      its way into the world. We supposed that God had made a mistake in sending
      it to Lilith, and that was why He had taken it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our difficulty rose from the fact that Lilith did not appear ever to have
      been married. The fierce man was not her husband. So far as we could
      discover from the gipsy children she had never had a husband. Then she
      couldn&rsquo;t have had a honeymoon: and, if she had never had a honeymoon, she
      oughtn&rsquo;t to have had a baby. Our ideas on the question of birth were
      utterly disorganized. There was only one explanation&mdash;that we had
      been misinformed by Hetty and people could have babies by themselves. The
      effect of this conjecture on Ruthita was revolutionizing: it made our
      honeymoon unnecessary and me entirely dispensable. She had only been
      persuaded to elope for the sake of exchanging dolls for babies, and now it
      appeared she could have them and her mother as well. I had no argument
      left with which to combat her desire to return. There was only one way of
      arriving at the truth on the subject, and that was by inquiring of Lilith.
      Neither of us would have done this for worlds after the way she had cried
      when we found that her back was no longer bulgy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The days grew shorter and the forest became bare. We could see long
      distances now between the tree-trunks; it was as though the branches had
      fisted their hands. Holiday-seekers came to the cocoanut-shies less and
      less. The fierce man, whom we learnt to call G&rsquo;liath, had hardly any
      bruises on his face and hands; he dodged the balls easily. The few chance
      throwers had no crowd to make them reckless; they shied singly now and not
      in showers. The gaudily dressed woman lost her hoarseness. She no longer
      had to shout night and morning, &ldquo;Two shies a penny. Two shies a penny.
      Every ball &rsquo;its a cocoanut. Down she goes,&rdquo; etc. Why should she?
      There was no one to get excited&mdash;nobody to pay her pennies. Instead
      she sat by the fire, weaving wicker-baskets, watching the pearl-colored
      smoke go up in whiffs and eddies. Though she seldom said anything, she had
      taken a fancy to Ruthita and would spread for her a corner of her skirt
      that she might sit beside her while she worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day as Ruthita became more sure that she could have a baby all by
      herself, she wanted to go home more badly. One evening the gaudy woman
      found her crying. She told G&rsquo;liath that next morning he must harness in
      his little moke and go for Mr. Spreckles. I did not hear her tell him, but
      Lilith told me when she came to lie down beside me in the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night she held me closer. I could feel her heart thumping. She roused
      me continually in the darkness to ask me needless questions. Whether I
      would ever forget her. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Whether I would like to see her again. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
       Whether I would like to become a gipsy. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t I!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for so long that I began to drowse. I awoke with the
      tightening of her arms about me. When I lifted my face to hers, she
      commenced to kiss me passionately. &ldquo;You shall. You shall,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      make a gipsy of you, so you&rsquo;ll always remember and never be content with
      their closed-in world. They&rsquo;ll take you from me to-morrow, but your heart
      will never be theirs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t understand, but at dawn she showed me. Frost lay on the ground.
      Every little blade of grass was stiff and sword-like. It was as though the
      hair of the world had turned white from shock and was standing on end.
    </p>
    <p>
      She led me away through the tall stark forest to a glade so secret that no
      one could observe us. At first I thought she was escaping with me,
      carrying me off to her gipsy-land. But she made me kneel down beside her.
      As the sun wheeled above the cold horizon she snatched a little knife from
      beneath her dress, and pricked her wrist and mine so that they bled. She
      held her hand beneath our wrists, catching the blood in her palm so it
      mingled. Then she let it drip through her fingers, making scarlet stains
      on the frosted turf.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it fell she spoke to the grass and the trees and the air, telling them
      that I was hers and, because our blood was mingled, was one of them.
      &ldquo;Whenever he hears your voice,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it will speak to him of me. If
      he goes where you do not grow, oh grass, then the trees shall call him
      back. If he goes where you do not grow, oh trees, then the wind shall tell
      him. His hand shall be as ours, against the works of men. When he hears
      your voice, oh grass, or your voice, oh trees, or your voice, oh winds, he
      shall turn his face from walls and come back. Though he leaves us he shall
      always hear us calling, for he is ours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it seemed to me when her voice had ceased that I heard the grass
      nodding its head. From the dawn came a breath of wind, sweeping through
      the trees, stooping their leafless branches as though they gave assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      That morning for the first time we had breakfast in the caravan. After
      breakfast Lilith and I went out together, hand-in-hand. G&rsquo;liath was
      harnessing in his donkey. We watched him drive down the road and vanish. I
      did not want to go back and he knew it; he looked ashamed of himself. The
      country was bitter and cheerless; it had an atmosphere of parting&mdash;everything
      was withered. Birds huddled close on branches with ruffled feathers.
      Fields were harsh and cracked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little brother,&rdquo; Lilith said, &ldquo;one day you will be a man. Until then they
      will keep you prisoner and try to make you forget all the things which you
      and I have learnt. They will tell you that the trees have no voices: that
      it is only the wind that stirs them. They will tell you that rivers are
      only water flowing. But remember that out in the open they are all waiting
      for you, and that the other people who have no bodies are there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought of the picture I had seen in the pool and knew what she meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards evening we returned to the camp. The melancholy autumn twilight
      lay about us; in the heart of it the fire burnt red. We sat round it in
      silence, watching the hard white road through the trees and listening for
      G&rsquo;liath coming back. &ldquo;Ruthita,&rdquo; I whispered, &ldquo;do you think we shall find
      the little house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head doubtfully, as if she scarcely cared. She was thinking
      of the lighted room, perhaps, and the long white bed, where her mother was
      eagerly awaiting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming up the road we heard a sharp tap-a-tap. Dancing in and out the
      tree-trunks we saw the golden eyes of carriage-lamps. The dog-cart and
      Dollie came into sight and halted; my Uncle Obad jumped out. He had come
      alone to fetch us; I was glad of that. I could explain things to him so
      much more easily than to my father, and he was sure to understand.
      Catching sight of me by the fire, he ran forward and lifted me up in his
      arms. All he could say was, &ldquo;Well, well, well!&rdquo; His face was beaming;
      every little wrinkle in his face was trembling. He hugged me so tightly
      that he took away my breath. I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to speak until he had
      set me down. Then I said, &ldquo;Uncle Obad, this is Ruthita.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand to her gravely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pleased to meet you, Mrs. Dante
      Cardover,&rdquo; he said. Then, because she was such a little girl and her face
      looked so thin and wistful, he took her in his arms and hugged her as
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the gaudy woman remembered that we were still clothed in our
      gipsy rags. She wanted to take us into the caravan and dress us, but Uncle
      Obad wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it. He insisted on carrying us off to Pope Lane just
      as we were.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was night when he said, &ldquo;Dollie is rested; we must be going.&rdquo; When we
      rose to our feet to say good-by, Lilith was not there. He lifted us into
      the dog-cart and wrapped rugs about our shoulders to make us cozy. Then he
      jumped in beside us and we had our last look at the camp. The gaudy woman
      was standing up by the fire with her children huddled about her skirts. I
      could see the gleam of her ear-rings shaking, the lighted window of the
      caravan in the background, and the lurcher sneaking in and out the
      shadows. G&rsquo;liath and his donkey travelled slowly; they had not returned
      when we left. Uncle Obad cracked his whip; we started forward across the
      turf and were soon bowling between the dim skeletons of trees down the
      hard road homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruthita crept closer to me. She may have been cold and she may have been
      lonely, but I think she was just feeling how flat things were now our
      great adventure was over. She had feared it while it lasted; now,
      womanlike, she was wishing that it was not quite ended. Every now and then
      she drew her fingers across my face&mdash;a little love-trick she had. She
      leant her head against my shoulder and was soon sleeping soundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old chap, why did you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked up at my uncle; I could not see his face because of the darkness.
      His voice was very solemn and kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t see anything in the garden,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;we wanted to find where
      the pigeons went.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did you take the little girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hesitated about telling. It might spoil what was left of the magic; I
      still had a faint hope that by the time we reached Pope Lane I might have
      grown into a man. And then, in telling, I might do Hetty a damage. Instead
      of answering, I asked him a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re married, you get everything you want, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends on what you call everything, Dante.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, money, and a house, and a pony, and babies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke softly. Then I knew I oughtn&rsquo;t to have mentioned babies, because,
      like Lilith, he hadn&rsquo;t any.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t I who wanted the babies,&rdquo; I explained hurriedly; &ldquo;that was
      Ruthie. She wanted them instead of dolls to play with. I wanted to be
      allowed to go in and out, like the children with the magic carpet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knew at once what I meant. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t want to have grown people always
      bothering, telling you to do this and not to do that, and locking doors
      behind you? You wanted always to be free and jolly, like you and I are
      together? And you thought that you could be like that if you were
      married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He slowed Dollie down to a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little man, you&rsquo;ve been trying to get just what everyone&rsquo;s reaching
      after. When you&rsquo;re a boy you say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have it when I&rsquo;m a man.&rsquo; When
      you&rsquo;re a man you say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have it when I&rsquo;m married.&rsquo; You&rsquo;ve been
      searching for perpetual happiness. You&rsquo;ll never have it in this world,
      Dante. And don&rsquo;t you see why you&rsquo;ll never have it? You hurt other people
      in trying to get it. Your father and Ruthita&rsquo;s mother, all of us have been
      very anxious. I&rsquo;ve often been tempted to run away myself because I&rsquo;m not
      much use to anybody. But that would mean leaving someone I love; so I&rsquo;ve
      had to stop on and face it out. You ran away to enjoy yourself, and other
      people were sorry. Other people always have to be sorry when a fellow does
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook the reins over Dollie and she commenced to trot again. Presently
      he said, half-speaking to himself, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a better word than happiness,
      and that&rsquo;s duty. If a chap does his duty the best he can, he makes other
      folk happy. Then he finds his own happiness by accident, within himself.
      I&rsquo;m a queer one to be talking&mdash;I&rsquo;m not awfully successful. I&rsquo;ve run
      away a little. But you must do better. And if you can&rsquo;t bear things, just
      <i>imagine</i>. What&rsquo;s the difference between the things you really have
      and the things you pretend? Imagination is the magic carpet; you can
      pretend yourself anything and anywhere. If you&rsquo;ve learnt that secret, they
      can lock all the doors&mdash;it won&rsquo;t matter. I can&rsquo;t put it plainer;
      there are things that it isn&rsquo;t right for you to understand&mdash;this
      business about marriage. You&rsquo;ll know when you&rsquo;re a man. Now promise that
      you&rsquo;ll never run away again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we got to Pope Lane it must have been very late. I suppose I fell
      asleep on the journey, for I remember nothing more until the light flashed
      in my eyes and my father was bending over me. Ruthita wasn&rsquo;t there; she
      had been left already at her mother&rsquo;s house. My father had me in his arms.
      He was standing in the hall. The door was wide open and my uncle was going
      down the steps, calling &ldquo;Good-night&rdquo; as he went. Behind me I could see
      Hetty peering over the banisters in a gray flannel nightdress&mdash;her
      night-dresses were all of gray flannel. When my father turned, she
      scuttled away like a frightened rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He carried me into his study&mdash;just as I was, clad in my gipsy rags&mdash;and
      closed the door behind him with a slam. His lamp on the table was turned
      low. The floor was littered with books and papers. A fire in the hearth
      was burning brightly. He drew up an easy-chair to the blaze and sat down,
      still holding me to him. I was always timid with my father, especially
      when we were alone together. This time I was very conscious of
      wrong-doing. I waited to hear him say something; but he remained silent,
      staring into the fire. The lamp flickered lower and lower, and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I saw that he was crying. His tears splashed down. His face had lost
      that stem look. I was shaken by his sobs as he held me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little son. My little son,&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room grew fainter. The pictures on the walls became shadowy. My eyes
      opened and closed. When I awoke the gray light of morning was stealing in
      at the window. The fire had fallen away in ashes. The air was chilly. My
      father was sitting in the easy-chair, his head sunk forward&mdash;but his
      arms were still about me.

      CHAPTER IX&mdash;THE SNOW LADY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>y father never
      asked me why I had run away or where I had gone. His tongue was ever
      stubborn at loving with words. With Hetty it was different. When my father
      had wakened and let me out of his arms to go upstairs and dress, she
      caught me into her bosom and half-smothered me, scolding and comforting by
      turns. Her corsets hurt me and her starched print-dress was harsh; I was
      glad when she left off and set me down on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who ever &rsquo;eard the likes o&rsquo; that,&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;a little boy to
      run away from his dear Pa and take with &rsquo;im a little sweet-&rsquo;eart
      as we never knew &rsquo;e &rsquo;ad. Oh, the deceit of children for all
      they looks so h&rsquo;innercent! And &rsquo;ere was your dear Pa a-tearin&rsquo; all
      the &rsquo;air out of &rsquo;is &rsquo;ead. And &rsquo;ere was me and
      John&mdash;we couldn&rsquo;t do no work and we couldn&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo; for thinkin&rsquo;
      where you&rsquo;d went. And there was you a-livin&rsquo; with those dirty gipsies and
      wearin&rsquo; their dirty rags&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not dirty,&rdquo; I interrupted, &ldquo;and I shan&rsquo;t like you if you talk
      like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m only tellin&rsquo; you the truth; you was always perwerse and &rsquo;eadstrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell me the truth when you told me about marriage,&rdquo; I said.
      &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s just the same as when we left. We ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t any taller, and we
      hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t got a little house, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat back on her heels and stared at me. &ldquo;Oh, Lor,&rdquo; she burst out, &ldquo;was
      that why you did it?&rdquo; And then she began to laugh and laugh. Her face grew
      red and again she fell upon me, until her corsets cut into me to such an
      extent that I called to her to leave off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I told you was gorspel true,&rdquo; she said solemnly, &ldquo;but you didn&rsquo;t
      understand. That&rsquo;s wot &rsquo;appens to wimmen when they goes away with
      men. I wasn&rsquo;t speakin&rsquo; of little boys and girls. But it&rsquo;ll never &rsquo;appen
      to you when you grow up if you tell anybody wot I said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That morning after breakfast, instead of going into his study to work, my
      father led me round to the Favarts&rsquo;. As we came up the path I saw Ruthita
      at the window watching for us. Monsieur Favart opened the door to our
      knock. He said something to my father in French, shook me by the hand
      gravely, and led the way upstairs. We entered a room at the back of the
      house, overlooking the garden. A lady, almost as small as Ruthita, was
      lying on a couch with cushions piled behind her head. She was dressed
      completely in white; she had dark eyes and white hair, and a face that
      somehow surprised you because it was so young and little. From the first I
      called her the Snow Lady to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hand to me and then, instead, put her arm about my waist,
      smiling up at me. &ldquo;So you are Dante, the little boy who wanted to marry my
      little girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was more soft and emotional than any voice I had ever heard. It
      held me, and kept me from noticing anything but her. It seemed as though
      all the eagerness of living, which other people spend in motion, was
      stored up in that long white throat of hers and delicate scarlet mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t marry Ruth yet, you know,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t any money.
      But if you like, you may go and kiss her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned me about and there was Ruthita standing behind me. I did what I
      was told, shyly and perfunctorily. There was no sense of pleasure in doing
      what you were ordered to do just to amuse grown people. The Snow Lady
      laughed gaily. &ldquo;There, take him out into the garden, Ruthita, and teach
      him to do it properly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I left the room, I saw that my father had taken my place by the couch.
      Monsieur Favart was looking out of the window, his hands folded on the
      head of his cane and his chin resting on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We played in the garden together, but much of the charm had gone out of
      our playing now that it was allowed. The game we played was gipsies in the
      forest. We gathered leaves and made a fire, pretending we were again in
      camp. I was G&rsquo;liath; Ruthita was sometimes the gaudy woman and sometimes
      Lilith telling fortunes. But the pretense was tame after the reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruthie,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;we ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t married. What Hettie told me was all swank.
      It&rsquo;s only true of men and women, and not of boys and girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we can grow older.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But it&rsquo;ll take ages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She folded her hands in her pinafore nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can go on loving till then,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way home my father told me that he liked Ruthita&mdash;liked her so
      much that he had arranged with Madam Favart to have a door cut in the wall
      between the two gardens so that we could go in and out. I didn&rsquo;t tell him
      that I preferred climbing over; he could scarcely guess it for himself.
      There was no excitement in being pushed into the open and told to go and
      play with Ruthita. It was all too easy. The fun had been in no one knowing
      that I did play with such a little girl&mdash;not even knowing that there
      was a Ruthita in the world. We tried to overcome this by always pretending
      that we were doing wrong when we were together. We would hide when we
      heard anybody coming. I despised the door and only went through it when a
      grown person was present, otherwise I entered by way of the apple-tree and
      the wall. My father caught me at it, and couldn&rsquo;t understand why I did it.
      Hetty said it was because I liked being grubby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the gray autumn months I wandered the garden, listening to the
      dead leaves whispering together. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll take you from me, but your heart
      will never be theirs,&rdquo; Lilith had said, and I tried to fancy that the
      rustling of leaves was Lilith&rsquo;s voice calling. It was curious how she had
      plucked out my affections and made them hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often I would steal into the tool-house and tell the white hen all about
      it. But she also was a source of disillusionment. After long waiting I
      found one egg in her nest. I thought she must be as glad about it as I
      was, so left it there a little while for her to look at. I thought the
      sight of it would spur her on to more ambitious endeavors. But when I came
      back her beak was yellowy and the egg had vanished. After this unnatural
      act of cannibalism I told her no more secrets; she had proved herself
      unworthy. Shortly afterwards she died&mdash;perhaps of remorse. I made my
      peace with her by placing her in a cardboard shoe-box for a coffin and
      giving her a most handsome funeral.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, when I had been put to bed, I stole to the window to gaze
      into the blackness. I saw a man with a lantern go across our lawn and
      disappear by the apple-tree through the door in the wall. After that I
      watched. Nearly every night it happened. I was always too sleepy to stay
      awake to see at what hour he came back. But I knew that he did come back,
      for with the first fall of snow I traced his returning footsteps. They
      came from Monsieur Favart&rsquo;s door and entered in at our study-window. So I
      guessed that the man was my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madam Favart seemed to be growing stronger; she was able to get up and
      walk about. Sometimes I would go into her house for tea, and she would sit
      by the firelight and tell Ruthita and myself stories. She used to try and
      get me to climb on her knee while she told them. I always refused, because
      my mother used to do that. The Snow Lady used to laugh at me and say,
      &ldquo;Ruthita, Dante won&rsquo;t make love to Mother. Isn&rsquo;t he silly?&rdquo; Then I would
      grow sulky and sit as far off as I could.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Christmas came round, the Favarts were invited over to spend it with
      us. The Snow Lady brought a bunch of misletoe with her and hung it about
      our house. After dinner the General fell asleep in his chair, and we
      children played hide and seek together. I wanted to hide so securely that
      Ruthita would never catch me. It was getting dark, and I knew that she
      wouldn&rsquo;t hunt for me in my father&rsquo;s study. I was a little awed myself at
      going there. I pushed open the door. The room was unlighted. I entered,
      and then halted at the sound of voices whispering. Standing in the window,
      silhouetted against the snow, were my father and Madam Favart. He was
      holding a sprig of misletoe over her; his arm was about her, and they were
      leaning breast to breast. She saw me first and started back from him, just
      as Hetty had done when I found her with John. Then my father, turning
      sharply, saw me. He called to me sternly, &ldquo;Dante, what are you doing,
      sir?&rdquo; He sounded almost afraid because I had been watching. Then he called
      again more softly, &ldquo;Dante, my boy, come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But a strange rebellious horror possessed me. It seemed as though
      something were tearing out my heart. I was angry, fiercely angry because
      he had been disloyal to my mother. At that moment I hated him, but hated
      Madam Favart much worse. I knew now why she had told me stories, and why
      she had wanted me to climb on her knee, and why she had tried to force me
      to make love to her. I rushed from the room and down the passage. Ruthita
      ran out laughing to catch me, but I pushed her aside roughly and unjustly.
      I wanted to get away by myself and fled out into the snow-covered garden.
      My father came to the door and called. But Madam Favart was with him; I
      could see by the gaslight, which fell behind them, the way she pressed
      towards him. I could hear her merry contralto laugh, and refused to
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come by himself,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the door closed and they left me, I felt miserably lonely. They had
      been wicked and they were not sorry. Hetty said that God was twice as
      angry with you for not being sorry as He was with you for doing wrong.
      Hetty knew everything about God; she used to hold long conversations with
      Him every night in her gray flannel nightdress. Soon the snow began to
      melt into my shoes and the frost to nip&rsquo; my fingers. I wished they would
      come out again and call me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I became pathetic over the fact that it was Christmas. I pictured to
      myself a possible death as a result of exposure. I saw myself dying in a
      beautiful calm, forgiving everybody, and with everybody kneeling by my
      bedside shaken with sobbing; the sobs of Madam Favart and my father were
      to be the loudest. I was to be stretching out long white hands, trying to
      quiet them; but their sense of guilt was to have placed them beyond all
      bounds of consolation. Every time I tried to comfort them they were to cry
      twice as hard. Then I saw my funeral and the big lily wreaths: &ldquo;From his
      broken-hearted father&rdquo;; &ldquo;From Madam Favart with sincere regrets&rdquo;; &ldquo;From
      Hetty who told God untruths about him&rdquo;; &ldquo;From Ruthita who loved him.&rdquo; And
      in the midst of these tokens of grief I lay fully conscious of everything,
      arrayed in a gray flannel nightshirt, opening one eye when no one was
      looking, and winking at Uncle Obad.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to feel little pangs of hunger, and my pride gave way before them.
      Reluctantly I stole nearer the house and peeked into the study. They were
      all there seated round the fire, callously enjoying themselves. The secret
      was plainly out&mdash;my father was holding Madam Favart&rsquo;s hand. Ruthita
      was cuddled against my father&rsquo;s shoulder; she was evidently reconciled
      rather more than stoically. I tapped on the pane. The old General saw me.
      He signed to the others to remain still. He threw up the window and lifted
      me into the warmth. I believe he understood. Perhaps he felt just as I was
      feeling. At any rate, when it was decreed that I should go to bed at once
      and drink hot gruel, he slipped a crown-piece into my hand and looked as
      though he hadn&rsquo;t done it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a month the marriage was celebrated, my father being a methodical
      man who hated delays and loved shortcuts. It was a vicarious affair;
      Ruthita and I had taken the honeymoon, and our parents were married. If
      Uncle Obad hadn&rsquo;t given me the white hen, and the hen hadn&rsquo;t flown over
      the wall, and I hadn&rsquo;t followed, these things would never have happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      I grew to admire the Snow Lady immensely. She always called me her little
      lover. She never ordered me to do anything or played the mother, but
      flirted with me and trusted to my chivalry to recognize her wants. We
      played a game of pretending. It had only one disadvantage, that it shut
      Ruthita out from our game, for one couldn&rsquo;t court two ladies at once. I
      learnt to kiss Ruthita as a habit and to take her, as boys will their
      sisters, for granted. It is only on looking back that I realize how
      beautiful and gentle she really was, and what life would have been without
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Favart lived in the other house through the door in the wall. He
      came to visit us rarely. He leant more heavily on his cane, and his cloak
      seemed to have become blacker, his hair whiter, and his scar more
      prominent. He could scarcely speak a word of English, so I never knew what
      he thought. But it seemed to me he was sorrowing. One day we children were
      told that he was dead; after that the door between the two gardens was
      taken down and the hole in the wall bricked up.

      CHAPTER I&mdash;THE RED HOUSE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>ante, it&rsquo;s time
      you went to school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the past three years, since he had married the Snow Lady, my father
      had given me lessons in his study for the last hour of every morning
      before lunch. It had been the Snow Lady&rsquo;s idea; she said I was growing up
      a perfect ignoramus.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father tilted up his spectacles to his forehead, and gazed across the
      table at me thoughtfully. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be sorry to lose you,
      my boy; but it&rsquo;s time you went to school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was to lose me; then I was to go away! My heart sank, and leapt, and
      sank again with a dreadful joy of expectation. In my childish way I had
      always been impatient of the present&mdash;a Columbus ceaselessly watching
      for the first trace of seaweed broken loose from the shores of the
      unknown. Change, which at mid-life we so bitterly resent, was at that time
      life&rsquo;s great allurement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The school selected was one of the smaller public-schools, lying fifteen
      miles distant from Stoke Newington. It was called the Red House and stood
      on Eden Hill. It was situated in lovely country, so my father said, and
      had for its head-master a man with whom he was slightly acquainted, whose
      name was the Reverend Robert Sneard.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next few weeks I was a semi-hero. Ruthita regarded me with the
      kind of pitying awe that a bullock inspires in children, when they meet it
      being driven lowing along a road to be slaughtered. Everyone became busy
      over preparations for my departure&mdash;even the Snow Lady, who seldom
      worked. I was allowed to sit up quite late, watching her pretty fingers
      flashing the needle in and out the flannel that grew into shirts for me to
      wear. Ruthita would snuggle up beside me, her long black curls tickling my
      cheek. There were lengthy silences. Then Ruthita would look up at her
      mother and say, &ldquo;Mumsie, I don&rsquo;t know whatever we shall do without him.&rdquo;
       And sometimes, when she said it, the Snow Lady would laugh in her Frenchy
      way and answer, &ldquo;Why, Ruthita, what&rsquo;s one little boy? He&rsquo;s so tiny; he
      won&rsquo;t leave much empty space.&rdquo; But once, it was the night before I left,
      she choked in the middle of her laughing and took us both into her arms,
      telling us that she loved us equally. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think what I&rsquo;ll do without
      my little lover,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of a sudden I had become, a person of importance. The servants no longer
      made a worry of doing things for me. They watched me going about the house
      as though it were for the last time, and spoke of me to one another as,
      &ldquo;Poor little chap.&rdquo; I had only to express a want to have it gratified. I
      was treated as the State treats a condemned criminal on the day of his
      execution, when they let him choose his breakfast. I gloried in my
      eminence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was arranged that my uncle should drive me to the Red House. Before I
      went, I was loaded with good advice. My father sent for me to his study
      one night and, with considerable embarrassment, alluded to subjects of
      which I had no knowledge, imploring me to listen to no evil companions but
      to keep pure. His language was so delicately veiled that I was none the
      wiser. I thought he referred to such boyish peccadilloes as jam stealing
      and telling lies. Even the Snow Lady, who took delight in being frivolous,
      read me a moral story concerning the rapid degeneration, through
      cigarettes and beer-drinking, of a boy with the face of an angel. Neither
      of these temptations was mine, and I had never regarded myself as
      particularly angelic in appearance. They beat about the bush, hunting
      ghostly passions with allegories.
    </p>
    <p>
      I noticed that Ruthita would absent herself for an hour or more at a
      stretch. When I followed her up to her room the door was locked, and she
      would beseech me with tears in her voice not to peek through the key-hole.
      The mystery was explained when she presented me with a knitted muffler,
      the wool for which she had purchased from her own savings. I came across
      it, moth-eaten and faded, in my old school play-box the other day. It was
      cold weather when she made it, for a little girl to sit in a bedroom
      without a fire. I hope I thanked her sufficiently and did not accept her
      surprise as though it were expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      On an afternoon in January I departed. Then I realized for the first time
      what going away from home meant. The horror of the unknown, not the
      adventure, pressed upon me. We all pretended to be very gay&mdash;all
      except Hetty, who threw her apron over her head and, in the old scripture
      phrase, lifted up her voice and wept. They accompanied me out of the
      garden, down Pope Lane, to where the dog-cart was tethered. I mounted
      reluctantly, stretching out the last moment to its greatest length, and
      took my place beside Uncle Obad. My father had his pen behind his ear, I
      remember. It seemed to me as though the pen were saying, &ldquo;Hurry up now and
      get off. Your father can&rsquo;t waste all day over little boys.&rdquo; Dollie lifted
      her head and began to trot. The Snow Lady waved and waved, smiling
      bravely. Then Ruthita broke from the group and ran after us down the long
      red street for a little way. We turned a corner and they were lost to
      sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      I drew nearer to my uncle, pressing Ruthita&rsquo;s muffler to my lips and
      gazing straight before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;what&rsquo;ll it be like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; he muttered huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      After about an hour&rsquo;s driving, he broke the silence with a kindly effort
      to make conversation. He told me that we were on the Great North Road,
      where there used to be highwaymen. He spoke of Dick Turpin and some of his
      exploits. He pointed out a public-house at which highwaymen used to stay.
      He could not stir my imagination&mdash;it was otherwise occupied. I was
      wondering why I should be sent to school, if my going made everyone
      unhappy. I was picturing the snug nursery, with the lamp unlighted, and
      the fire burning, and Ruthita seated all alone on the rug before the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      We left the Great North Road, striking across country, through frosty
      lanes. My uncle ceased speaking; he himself was uninterested in what he
      had been saying. We passed groups of children playing before clustered
      cottages, and laborers plodding homeward whistling. It seemed strange to
      me that they should all be so cheerful and should not realize what was
      happening inside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      We came in sight of the Red House. It could be seen at a great distance,
      for it stood out gauntly on the crest of Eden Hill, and the sunset lay
      behind it. In the lowlands night was falling; lights were springing up,
      twinkling cheerfully. But the Red House did not impress me as cheerful&mdash;it
      had no lights, and struck me with the chill and repression that one feels
      in passing by a prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, old chap, we&rsquo;re nearly there,&rdquo; said my uncle with a futile attempt
      to be jolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I darted out my hand and dragged on the reins. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t drive so
      fast. Let Dollie walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked down at me slantwise. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to be brave, old chap.
      Nothing&rsquo;s as bad as it seems at the time. Nothing&rsquo;s so bad that it can&rsquo;t
      be lived through. Why, one day you&rsquo;ll be looking back and telling yourself
      that these were your happiest days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Despite his optimisms, he did as I requested and let Dollie walk the rest
      of the way. While she climbed the hill, we got out and walked beside her.
      My uncle put his hand in his pocket, and drew out a half-crown. He
      balanced it in his palm; tossed it; put it back into his pocket; drew it
      out again. &ldquo;Here, Dante,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;see what I&rsquo;ve found. You&rsquo;d
      best take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As we approached nearer, he was again moved to generosity. He was moved
      three times, to be exact; each time he considered the matter carefully,
      then rushed the coin at me. He gave me seven shillings in all. I am sure
      he could ill afford them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the top of the hill he beckoned me to jump into the trap. It was
      fitting, I suppose, that we should drive up to my place of confinement
      grandly. Then a great idea seized me. My box was under the seat behind. I
      had all my belongings with me. There were no walls to restrain us now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; I whispered, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go there. You once said you were
      tired of houses. Why shouldn&rsquo;t we run away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He heard the tremble in my voice. He lifted me in beside him and drove
      along the outside of the school-walls, not entering at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beastly hard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the trouble is that I can&rsquo;t explain it.
      All through life you&rsquo;ll be wanting to run away, and all through life, if
      you&rsquo;re not a coward, you won&rsquo;t be able. You see, people have to earn a
      living in this world, and to earn a living they must be educated. Your
      father&rsquo;s trying to give you the best education he can, and he means to be
      kind. But it&rsquo;s a darned shame, this not being able to do what you like. I
      can&rsquo;t run away with you, old chap. There&rsquo;s nothing for it; you&rsquo;ve just got
      to bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, searching for words. He wanted to tell me something really
      comforting and wasn&rsquo;t content with what he had said. He found it. Turning
      round in the dogcart, he threw his arm about my shoulder and pointed above
      my head, &ldquo;Look up, there.&rdquo; I raised my eyes and saw the blue black sky
      like an inverted cup, with a red smudge round the western rim where a
      mouth of blood had stained it. One by one the silver stars were coming out
      and disappearing, like tiny bubbles which break and form again. As I
      looked, night seemed to deepen; horizons dropped back; the earth fell
      away. The sky was no longer a cup; it was nothing measurable. It was a
      drifting sea of freedom, and I was part of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can rob you of a lot of things,&rdquo; my uncle said, &ldquo;but they can never
      take that from you. It&rsquo;s like the world of your imagination, something
      that can&rsquo;t be stolen, and that you can&rsquo;t sell, and that you can&rsquo;t buy.
      It&rsquo;s always yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We drove through the gate to the main entrance. My box was deposited in
      the hall. My uncle shook hands with me in formal manner when he said
      good-by, for the school-porter was present. He turned round sharply to cut
      proceedings short, and disappeared into the night. I listened to his
      wheels growing fainter. For the first time I was utterly alone.

      CHAPTER II&mdash;CHILDISH SORROWS AND CHILDISH COMFORTERS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n delicate
      schoolboy slang, I was a new-bug&mdash;a thing to be poked and despised,
      and not to be spoken to for the first few days. There were other new-bugs,
      which was some consolation; but we were too shy to get acquainted. We
      moped about the playground sullen and solitary, like crows on a plowed
      field. Every now and then some privileged person, who was not a new-bug,
      would bang our shins with a hockey-stick; after which we would hop about
      on one leg for a time, looking more like crows than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Snow Lady had packed fifty oranges in my box. I made holes in the tops
      of them with my thumb and rammed in lumps of sugar, sucking out the juice.
      Not because I was greedy, but because there seemed nothing else to do, I
      ate every one of the fifty the first day. The following night I was ill,
      which did not help my popularity. One dark-haired person, about my own
      age, with a jolly freckled face, took particular offense at my
      misdemeanor. His real name was Buzzard, but he was nicknamed the Bantam
      because of his size and his temper. He never said a word about the
      oranges, but he punished me for having been ill by stamping on my toes. He
      did this whenever he passed me, looking in the opposite direction in an
      absent-minded fashion. My quietness in putting up with him seemed to
      irritate him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon was frosty; I was hobbling miserably about the playground
      with Ruthita&rsquo;s muffler round my throat. It was a delicate baby-pink, and
      the Bantam easily caught sight of it. He came up and jerking it from me,
      trod on it. I had never fought in my life, but my wretchedness made me
      reckless. I thought of little Ruthita and the long cold hours she had
      spent in making it. It seemed that he had insulted her. I hit him savagely
      on the nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately there were cries of, &ldquo;A fight! A fight!&rdquo; Games were stopped.
      Boys came running from every direction. Even the new-bugs lifted up their
      heads and began to take an interest in the landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve done it,&rdquo; the Bantam shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started out, accompanied by the crowd to the bottom of the playground.
      I followed. The laboratory, a long black shed, stood there, with a roof of
      galvanized iron and rows of bottles arranged in the windows. Behind it we
      were out of sight of masters, unless they happened to be carrying on
      experiments inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ring was formed. The Bantam commenced to take off his coat and collar. I
      did likewise. A horrid sickening sense of defenselessness came over me. I
      experienced what the early Christians must have felt when they gazed round
      the eager amphitheatre, and heard the lions roaring.
    </p>
    <p>
      A big fellow stepped up. &ldquo;Here, new-bug, d&rsquo;you know how to fight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I shook my head, he grinned at me cheerfully. &ldquo;Hold your arms well
      up, double your fists, and go for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The advice was more easy to give than to put into action. The Bantam was
      on top of me in a flash. He made for my face at first, but I lowered my
      head and kept my arms up, so he was content to pummel me about the body.
      He hurt, and hurt badly; I had never been treated so roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something happened. Perhaps it was a fierce realization of the injustice
      of everything&mdash;the injustice of being sent there by people whom I
      loved, the injustice of not being spoken to, the injustice of the boys
      jeering because I was getting thrashed. I felt that I did not care how
      much I got damaged if only I might kill the Bantam. He thumped me on the
      nose as I looked up; my eyes filled with tears. I dashed in at him,
      banging him about the head. I heard his teeth rattle. I heard the
      shouting, &ldquo;Hurrah! Go it, new-bug. Well done, new-bug.&rdquo; In front of me the
      wintry sunset lay red. I remember wondering whether it was sunset or
      blood. Then the Bantam tried to turn and run. I caught him behind the ear.
      He tripped up and fell. I stood over him, doubtful whether he were dead.
      Just then the door of the laboratory opened. The boys began to scatter,
      shouting to one another, &ldquo;The Creature! Here he comes. The Creature!&rdquo; The
      Bantam picked himself up and followed the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man came round the side of the shed. He looked something like
      Dot-and-Carry-One, only he was smaller. His hair was the color of a
      badger&rsquo;s, shaggy and unbrushed. His face was stubbly and besmirched with
      different colored chalks from his fingers. His clothes were stained and
      baggy. He approached sideways, crabwise, in a great hurry, with one hand
      stretched out behind and one in front, like flappers. His gestures were
      those of a servant in a Chinese etching; they made him absurdly
      conspicuous by their self-belittlement. Beyond everything, he was dirty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What they been beating you for?&rdquo; he inquired in his shorthand way of
      talking. &ldquo;You hit him first! What for?&rdquo; He pulled a stump of a pencil out
      of his mouth as though he were drawing a tooth. After that I could hear
      him more clearly. &ldquo;A muffler? He trod on it? Well, that&rsquo;s nothing to fight
      about. Oh, your sister gave it you? That&rsquo;s different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last two sentences were spoken very gently&mdash;quite unlike the
      rest, which had been angry. &ldquo;Humph! His sister gave it him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took me by the hand and led me into the shed, closing the door behind
      him. An iron stove was burning. The outside was red hot; it glowered
      through the dusk. Running round the sides of the room were taps and
      basins, and above them bottles. Ranged on the table in the middle were
      stands, bunsen-burners and retorts. He went silently about his work. He
      was melting sulphur in a crucible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every now and then the sulphur caught and burnt with a violet flame; and
      all the while it made a suffocating smell.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt scared. I didn&rsquo;t know what he was going to do with me. The boys had
      called him The Creature, which sounded very dreadful. He had dragged me
      into his den just like the ogres the Snow Lady read about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently his experiment ended. He gave me a seat by the stove, and came
      and sat beside me. He didn&rsquo;t look at all fierce now. He struck me as old
      and discouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always fight for your sister,&rdquo; he said. Then after a pause, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s she
      called?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I found myself telling him that she wasn&rsquo;t really my sister, that her name
      was Ruthita, and that she had knitted me the muffler. He patted me on the
      knee as I talked. He might almost have been The Spuffler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys are horrid beasts,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t mean to be unkind. They,
      don&rsquo;t think&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. Soon you&rsquo;ll be one of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led the way out of the laboratory, turning the key behind him. The bell
      in the tower was ringing for supper. The school was all lit up. He climbed
      the railing which divided the playground from the football field, telling
      me to follow. We passed across the meadows to the village, which lay on
      the northward side of Eden Hill; it snuggled among trees. The cottages
      were straw-thatched. Frost glistened on the window-panes, behind which
      lamps were set. Unmelted snow glimmered here and there in the gardens in
      patches among cabbage stumps. We turned in at a gate. The Creature raised
      the latch of the door and we entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      How cozy the little house was after the bare stone corridors and cold,
      boarded dormitories. All the furnishings of the room into which he led me
      were worn and out-of-date; but they had a homelike look about them which
      atoned for their shabbiness. The walls bulged. Pictures hung awry upon
      them. The springs of the sofa had burst; you sank to an unexpected depth
      when you sat upon it. The carpet was threadbare; patch-work rugs covered
      the worst places. Yet for all its poverty, you knew that it was a room in
      which people had loved and been kind to one another. An atmosphere of
      memory hung about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Creature appeared to be his own house-keeper. He left me alone while
      he went somewhere into the back to get things ready. I could hear him
      striking matches and jingling cups against saucers.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I sat looking curiously round at wax-fruit in glass-cases and a stuffed
      owl on the mantel-shelf, the door was pushed open gently. An old lady
      entered. She trod so lightly, gliding her feet along the floor, that I
      should not have heard her save for the turning of the handle. She was
      dressed from head to foot in clinging muslin. Her face and hands were so
      frail and white that you could almost see through them. Her faded hair
      fell disordered and scanty about her shoulders. Her eyes were unnaturally
      large and luminous. She showed no surprise at seeing me. She looked at me
      so stealthily that she seemed to establish a secret. Crossing her hands on
      her breast she courtesied, and then asked me as odd a question as was ever
      addressed to a little boy. &ldquo;Are you my Lord?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, mam,&rdquo; I faltered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Dante Cardover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her look of intense eagerness faded, and one of almost childish
      disappointment took its place. She moved slowly about the room, from
      corner to corner, bowing to people whom I could not see and whispering to
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      My host came shuffling along the passage. He was carrying a tea-tray. When
      he saw the woman, he set it hurriedly down on the table and went quietly
      towards her. &ldquo;Gipie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Egypt, we&rsquo;re not alone; we have a guest.
      Tell them to go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke to her soothingly, as though she were a child. Her eyes narrowed,
      the strained far-away expression left her face. She made a motion with her
      hand, dismissing the invisible persons. He led her to me. It was strange
      to see a grown woman follow so obediently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gipie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want you to listen to me. This boy is my friend. They
      were fighting him up there,&rdquo; jerking his head in the direction of the
      school. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s lonely; so I brought him to you. Tell him that you care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady lifted her hands to my shoulders&mdash;such pale hands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      sorry,&rdquo; she said. It was like a child repeating a lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      He introduced us. &ldquo;This is my sister, Egypt; and this is Dante Cardover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t know what we talked about. I can only remember that the little old
      man and woman were kind to me and gave me courage. There are desolate
      moments in life when one hour of sympathy calls out more gratitude than
      years of easy friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night as the Creature walked back with me from his cottage, he told
      me to come to him whenever I was lonely. At the Red House he explained my
      absence to the house-master. I went upstairs to the dormitory, with its
      rows of twelve white beds down either side, feeling that I had parted from
      a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I undressed in the darkness the Bantam spoke to me. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t mean to
      fight you, Cardover. Make it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I made it up that night with the boy whose nose I had punched. He was a
      decent little chap when off his dignity. We began to make confidences in
      whispers; I suppose the darkness helped us. He told me that his father was
      in India and that he hadn&rsquo;t got a mother. I told him about the Snow Lady,
      and Hetty, and Uncle Obad; I didn&rsquo;t tell him about Ruthita because of the
      muffler. Then I began to ask him about the Creature. I wanted to know if
      that was his name. The Bantam laughed. &ldquo;Course not. He&rsquo;s Murdoch the
      stinks&rsquo; master. We call him the Creature &rsquo;cause he looks like one.
      Weren&rsquo;t you funky when he took you to his rabbit-hutch? Was Lady Zion
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Zion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Lady Zion Holy Ghost she calls herself. She&rsquo;s his sister, and she&rsquo;s
      balmy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was going to enter into some interesting details about her, when the
      monitor and the elder boys came up. He hid his face in the pillow and
      pretended to be sleeping soundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Bantam needs hair-brushing,&rdquo; the monitor announced. &ldquo;Here you, wake
      up. You&rsquo;re shamming.&rdquo; He pulled the clothes off the Bantam&rsquo;s bed with one
      jerk. The Bantam sat up, rubbing his eyes with a good imitation of having
      just awakened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out you come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One boy held his hands and another his legs, bending his body into a
      praying attitude. He fought like a demon, but to no purpose. They yanked
      his night-shirt up, while the monitor laid into him with the bristly side
      of a hairbrush. He addressed him between each blow. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one for
      bullying a new-bug. And that&rsquo;s another for fighting. And that&rsquo;s another
      for being licked and getting in a funk, etc.&rdquo; By the time they had done he
      was sobbing bitterly. Then the light went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose I ought to have been glad at being avenged; but I wasn&rsquo;t.
      Somehow I felt that the big boys had punished him not from a sense of
      justice, but only because they were big and wanted to amuse themselves.
      Then I got to thinking what a long way off India was, and how dreadful it
      must make a boy feel never to see his father. It had been a long while
      dark in the dormitory and almost everyone was breathing heavily. I
      stretched out my hand across the narrow alley which separated me from the
      Bantam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bantam,&rdquo; I whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He snuffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bantam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt his fingers clutch my hand. I crept out and put my arms about him.
      Then I got into his bed and curled up beside him, and so we both were
      comforted.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III&mdash;THE WORLD OF BOYS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Bantam and I
      became great friends. He was a brave daredevil little chap, prematurely
      hardened by the absence of home influences to make the best of life&rsquo;s
      vicissitudes. Within an hour of having been beaten, he would be gay again
      as ever. He was a soldier&rsquo;s son, and never wasted time in pitying himself.
      He was greedy for joy, as I am to this day, and we contrived to find it
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, when I look back, the making of happiness at the Red House seems to
      me to have been very much like manufacturing bricks without straw. I am
      amazed at our success. Very slight provision was made for our comfort. Our
      daily routine was in no way superior to that of a barrack; the only
      difference was that they drilled our heads instead of our arms and legs.
      The feminine influence was entirely lacking, and a good deal of brutality
      resulted. If the parents could have guessed half the shocking things that
      their fresh-faced innocent looking darlings did and said in the three
      months of each term that they were away from home, they would have been
      broken-hearted. And yet they might have guessed. For here were we, young
      animals in every stage of adolescence, herded together in class-rooms and
      dormitories, uninformed about ourselves, with only paid people to care for
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from the masters we governed ourselves by a secret code of honor.
      One of the favorite diversions, when things were dull, was to find some
      boy who was unpopular, in a breach of schoolboy etiquette. He would then
      be led into a class-room, held down over a desk, and thrashed with
      hockey-sticks. I have seen a boy receive as many as ninety strokes, laid
      on by various young barbarians who took a pride in seeing who could hit
      hardest. Usually at the end of it the victim was nearly fainting, and
      would be lame for days after. The masters knew all about such proceedings,
      but they were too indifferent to interfere. They boasted that they trusted
      to the school&rsquo;s sense of justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      A boy, who was at all sensitive, went about in a state of terror. If you
      escaped hockey-sticks by day, there was always the dormitory and
      hair-brush to be dreaded. The way to get beyond the dread of such
      possibilities was to make yourself popular, and the easiest way to become
      popular was to play ingenious pranks on the masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glorious hours of liberty that broke up the monotonous round of tasks
      stand out in vivid contrast to the discipline. We lived for them and kept
      charts of the days, because this seemed to bring them nearer. There were
      two half-holidays a week, Wednesdays and Saturdays, on which, if
      sufficient excuse were given, we were allowed to go out of the
      school-grounds. If the permission were withheld, we broke bounds and took
      the risk of discovery and consequent thrashings. These stolen expeditions
      had a zest about them that made them the more pleasurable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bantam and I did most things together. We had a common fund of money.
      His memories of India lent a touch of romance to our friendship. He would
      spin long yarns of man-eating tigers and terrible battles with
      hill-tribes. He had a lurid imagination and added some fresh detail each
      time he told his tales. Not to be behindhand, I narrated my escape to the
      forest&mdash;leaving out the Ruthita part of it&mdash;and how Lilith had
      made me a gipsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      These stories became a secret between us which we shared with no one. We
      created for ourselves a mirage world which we called IT. In IT we had only
      to speak of things and they happened. In IT there were man-eating tigers
      to whom we threw our masters when they had been unpleasant to us. We would
      drag them by their feet through the jungle, and then let out a low
      blood-thirsty wailing sound. Immediately we had done it, we would drop our
      victim and climb trees, for we could hear the tigers coming. The victim
      was bound so he couldn&rsquo;t run away and while he lay there &ldquo;in the long rank
      grass with bulging eyes,&rdquo; we would remind him of his crimes committed at
      the Red House. The account of his tortures and dying words would become a
      dialogue between the Bantam and myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the tiger seized him by the arm and chawed him,&rdquo; the Bantam would
      say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the other tiger seized him by the leg, pulling in an opposite
      direction,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then old Sneard looked up at me, with imploring eyes. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been a
      beast,&rsquo; he moaned, &lsquo;and you were always a good boy. Call them off for the
      sake of my little girl.&rsquo; But I only laughed sepulchrally,&rdquo; said the
      Bantam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your little girl will be jolly well glad when you&rsquo;re dead,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody will be glad,&rdquo; said the Bantam. &ldquo;And then a third tiger crept
      out of the bushes and bit off his head, putting an end to his agony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t have killed him so soon,&rdquo; I would expostulate discontentedly.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d got something else I wanted to do to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; the Bantam would assent cheerfully; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s kill him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So real was this land of IT to us, that we would shout with excitement as
      we reached the climax of our narrations. The English fields through which
      we wandered became swamps, deserts, and forests at will.
    </p>
    <p>
      It became part of our game to pretend that we might meet Lilith any day.
      Often we would break bounds, stealing down country lanes and peering
      through hedges, hoping that at the next turn we should discover her seated
      before her camp-fire. Hope deferred never curbed our eagerness; we always
      believed that we should meet her next time.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we did not meet Lilith, we met someone equally strange&mdash;Lady Zion,
      the Creature&rsquo;s sister. It was the Bantam who told me all about her. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
      wrong up there,&rdquo; he said, tapping his forehead. &ldquo;She thinks she&rsquo;s
      something out of the Bible; that&rsquo;s why she calls herself Lady Zion Holy
      Ghost. She goes about the country dressed in white, riding on a donkey,
      muttering to herself, looking for someone she can never find. She thinks
      that she&rsquo;s in love with old Sneard, and that he don&rsquo;t care for her. They
      say that once he was going to marry her and then threw her over. That&rsquo;s
      what sent her balmy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I grew older I learnt the truth about the Creature and his sister. He
      became a firm friend of mine before schooldays were ended. He was a man
      who possessed a faculty for not getting on in the world which, had it been
      of value, would have amounted to genius. Anyone else with his brains and
      instinct for daring guess-work in scientific experiment, would have made a
      reputation. Instead of which he pottered his life out at the Red House,
      defending his sister and allowing himself to be imposed on both by boys
      and masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Popularity was the armor which permitted you to do almost anything with
      impunity. A boy would take almost any chance to get it. Very early in my
      school experience the Bantam thought out a plan which he invited me to
      share&mdash;with the dire result that I was brought into intimate contact
      with Mr. Sneard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every night between seven and eight the lower forms assembled to prepare
      their next day&rsquo;s lessons. The Creature usually presided, chiefly because
      he was good-natured and the other masters were lazy. It was part of his
      penance. The room in which we assembled was illumined by oil-lamps, which
      hung low on chains from the ceiling. If the chimney of one of these broke,
      the light became so bad in that quarter that work was suspended until it
      had been replaced. The Bantam conceived the happy idea of persuading them
      to break in an almost undiscoverable manner. It was simplicity itself&mdash;to
      spit across the room so skilfully as to hit the chimney, whereupon the
      moisture on the hot glass would cause it to crack. We practised at sticks
      and gate-posts in the fields at first; having become more or less
      proficient, we practised aiming at objects above our heads. This was more
      difficult. Our progress was slow; it was dry work. Still, within a month
      we considered ourselves adepts.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night in prep we put our plan to the test. The Creature was seated at
      his raised desk, absorbed in some scientific work. The Bantam, judging his
      distance carefully, took aim and the chimney cracked. As soon as the
      lamp-boy had been sent for and the chimney had been replaced, it was my
      turn. I was no less successful. For a week prep was disorganized; every
      night the same thing happened. I felt secretly ashamed of myself, for I
      knew that I was behaving meanly to a man who had always been kind in his
      dealings with me; but I was intoxicated with popularity. The Bantam and I
      were the heroes of the hour. Boys who had never condescended to speak to
      us, now offered us their next week&rsquo;s pocket-money to instruct them in an
      art in which we excelled. Games were abandoned. All over the play-ground
      groups of young ruffians might be seen industriously spitting at some
      object by the hour together.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose the Creature must have watched us from the laboratory and put
      two and two together. One night, when three chimneys had broken in
      succession, he caught me in mid-act. I say he caught me, but he did not so
      much as look up from the book he was reading. He just said, without
      raising his head, &ldquo;Cardover, you must report yourself to Mr. Sneard
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To have to report oneself to Mr. Sneard was the worst punishment that an
      under-master could measure out. Somehow it had never entered my head that
      the Creature would be so severe as that. Why, I might get expelled or
      publicly thrashed! My imagination conjured up all sorts of disgraces and
      grisly penalties.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night in the dormitory the Bantam told me of a way in which I might
      save myself; it was my first lesson in the value of diplomacy in helping
      one out of ticklish situations. It appeared that Mr. Sneard was always
      lenient with a boy who professed conversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day as I was hesitating outside his private room, screwing up my
      courage to tap, the Bantam sidled up behind me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going too,&rdquo; he said.
      Before I could dissuade him, he had turned the handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sneard was a sallow cadaverous person; he affected side-whiskers and had
      red hair. He wore clerical attire, the vest of which was very much spotted
      through his nearsightedness when he ate at table. He was probably the
      least scholarly master in the school, but he owed his position to his
      manners. They were unctuous, and had the reputation of going down with the
      parents. I suppose that was how he caught my father. He composed hymns,
      which he set to music and compelled us to sing on Sundays. They were
      mostly of the self-abasement order, in which we spoke of ourselves as
      worms and besought the Almighty not to tread on us. For years my mental
      picture of God was that of a gigantic school-master in holy orders, very
      similar in appearance to Sneard himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we entered, he was seated behind his desk writing. He prolonged our
      suspense by pretending not to see us for a while. Suddenly he cast aside
      his pen and wheeled round in a storm of furious anger. When he spoke, it
      sounded like a dog yapping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You young blackguards, what&rsquo;s this I hear about you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He forced us to tell him the stupid details of our offense. He could have
      had no sense of humor, for while we were speaking he covered his eyes with
      his hand as though staggered with horror at the enormity of our depravity.
      Later experience has taught me that what he meant us to believe was that
      he was engaged in prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When in small throaty whispers we had finished our confession, he looked
      up at us. &ldquo;Your poor, poor fathers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;one in India and one my
      friend! What shall I tell them? How shall I break this news to them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he straightened himself in his chair. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing else for it;
      Cardover, it&rsquo;s over there. Will you please fetch it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to a cane in the corner, which leant against a book-shelf. It
      was at this crisis that the Bantam made use of his stratagem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, sir, I&rsquo;ve been troubled about my soul again.&rdquo; Then he
      added loyally, &ldquo;And Cardover&rsquo;s been lying awake of nights thinking about
      hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If the truth be told I had been lying awake imagining Sneard being bled to
      death very slowly, and very torturingly, by a hill-tribe. But Sneard
      caught at the bait. &ldquo;I am glad to hear it. Cardover, before I cane you,
      come here and tell me about your views on hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before we left him, great crocodile tears were streaming from our eyes by
      reason of knuckles rubbed in vigorously. We were not punished. The last
      sight I had of Sneard he was gazing with holy joy at a great oil-painting
      of himself which hung above his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the boys in the Red House were converted many times&mdash;as often
      as they came within reach of the birch. Sneard made much coin out of
      referring to these touching spiritual experiences in public gatherings of
      parents. I have never been able to decide whether we really did fool him.
      I am inclined to believe that his eyes were wide open to our hypocrisy,
      but that he found it paid to encourage it. Part of his salary was derived
      from percentages on the tuition fees of all boys over a certain number. He
      found that the best card to play with parents for the attracting of new
      pupils, was a statement of the numerous conversions which were brought
      about through his influence.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV&mdash;NEW HORIZONS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Bantam and I
      won immunity from bullying in a quite unexpected manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our beds stood next together. Every night the younger boys were sent up to
      the dormitory at nine; fifteen minutes later the lights were turned out.
      The upper-classmen didn&rsquo;t come up till ten. For three-quarters of an hour
      each night we could whisper together in comparative privacy about IT,
      going on wildest excursions in our hidden land. Not unnaturally the
      curiosity of the other small boys of our dormitory was aroused&mdash;they
      wanted to share our secret, and we wouldn&rsquo;t let them. We were quite their
      match if it came to a fight, which was all the more irritating. We
      steadily refused to fight with them, or play with them, or to tell them
      anything. They became sulky and suspicious; in their opinion our
      conversation was too low to bear repetition. I suppose one of them must
      have sneaked to Cow&mdash;Cow was monitor of our dormitory. One night he
      came up early and on tiptoe. The first thing I knew he was standing in the
      darkness looking down on me, where I lay whispering on the Bantam&rsquo;s bed. I
      was fairly caught.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young&rsquo;un, what&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re saying?&rdquo; he asked sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      To have told him would have spoilt everything. Only when my night-shirt
      had been stripped off and I saw that a grand gala-night of hair-brushing
      was being planned, did I venture an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was only telling the Bantam a story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie. Let&rsquo;s hear it,&rdquo; said the Cow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t begin when you&rsquo;ve got my shirt,&rdquo; I expostulated. &ldquo;Let me get back
      into bed; then I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was arranged that I should be given a respite while the older boys
      undressed. Once safe in bed, I set my imagination galloping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once upon a time,&rdquo; I commenced, &ldquo;there was a great pirate and he was
      known as the Pirate King. He had a wife called One-Eye, and she was the
      only person he was afraid of in all the world. He sailed the blood-red
      seas with a crew of smugglers and highwaymen, most of whom he had rescued
      at the last minute from the gallows. They were devoted to him, and the
      vessel in which he sailed was called <i>The Damn</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The name of the vessel fetched them. There was no more talk of
      hair-brushing. At half-past ten the light went out and we heard old Sneard
      shuffling down the passage, going his final round of inspection. At each
      door he halted, lifting his candle above his head and craning out his long
      thin neck. Satisfied that all was in order, he shuffled on to his own
      quarters and we heard his door slam. That night I must have lain in the
      darkness recounting the adventures of the Pirate King till long past
      twelve. Every now and then a voice would interrupt me from one of the
      narrow white beds, asking a question. I fell asleep in the midst of my
      recounting.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that it became a practice that each night a fresh development in the
      life of this wonderful man should be unfolded. It was a good deal of a tax
      on the imagination, but the Bantam came to my help, and we told the story
      turn and turn about. We told how <i>The Damn</i> sailed into Peru and came
      back blood-drenched and treasure-laden; how the Pirate King took strange
      maidens to his breast in coloring all the way from alabaster to ebony, and
      what his wife One-Eye had to say about it; how the Pirate King could never
      be defeated and became so strong that he made himself Pope till he got
      tired of it. Discrepancies in chronology caused us no more inconvenience
      than they usually do historic novelists. In our world Joan of Arc and
      Julius Cæsar were contemporaries. They met for the first time as
      prisoners, when they were introduced by the Pirate King on board <i>The
      Damn</i>. It was owing to the Roman Emperor that the Maid escaped and
      survived to be burnt.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the part which found most favor was that which described the sack of
      London, and how the boys of the Red House enlisted with the pirates and
      took all the masters, except the Creature, out to sea and made them walk
      the plank. I refused to allow the Creature to be murdered.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the story became personal, the Bantam and I discovered ourselves the
      possessors of unlimited power. We were lords of the other boys&rsquo; destinies.
      We could make them heroes or cowards, give them fair maidens or forget to
      say anything about them. Frequently we received bribes to let the giver
      down easily or to make him appear more valiant. I&rsquo;m afraid we drifted into
      being tyrants, like Nero and all the other men whose wills have been
      absolute, and took our revenge with the rod of imagination. In the middle
      of some thrilling escapade of the pirates, when only courage could save
      them from calamity, we would tell how one of the boys in a near-by bed
      turned traitor and went over to the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the darkness would come an angry voice, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, you little
      beasts. You know quite well, I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you did,&rdquo; we would say, and proceed to make him appear yet more
      infamous. If he expostulated too frequently, arms would be reached out and
      a shower of boots would fly about his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our reputation spread beyond the dormitory; the history of the Pirate
      King, his wife One-Eye, and the good ship <i>Damn</i>, became a kind of
      school epic in which all the latest happenings at the Red House were
      chronicled. No one dared to offend us, small as we were. Like Benvenuto
      Cellini, sniffing his way through Europe and petulantly turning his back
      on kings and cardinals with impunity, we attained the successful genius&rsquo;s
      privilege of being detested for our persons, but treasured for our
      accomplishments. So at last we were popular in a fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      What contrasts of experience we had in those days!
    </p>
    <p>
      The crestfallen returns to the Red House, with play-boxes stuffed with
      feeble comfort in the shape of chocolates and cake; the long monotony of
      term-time with the dull lessons, the birchings, the flashes of excitement
      on half-holidays and the counting of the weeks till vacations came round;
      then the wild burst of enthusiasm when trunks were packed and Sneard had
      offered up his customary prayer in his accustomed language, and we set off
      shouting on the homeward journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the discipline and captivity were a small price to pay for the
      gladness of those home-comings. Ruthita would be at the end of the Lane
      waiting for me, a little shy at first but undeniably happy. The Snow Lady
      would be on the door-step, her pretty face all aglow with merriment. My
      father would forsake his study for the night and sit down to talk to me
      with all the leisure and courtesy that he usually reserved for grown men.
      Until they got used to me again I could upset my tea at table, slide down
      the banisters, and tramp through the house with muddy boots&mdash;no one
      rebuked me for fear the welcome should be spoiled. The Snow Lady called me
      The Fatted Calf, wilfully misinterpreting the Bible parable. Little by
      little Ruthita would lose her shyness; then we would begin to plan all the
      things we would do in the seemingly inexhaustible period of freedom that
      lay before us. In those days weeks were as long as years are now.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was once a time when I had no secrets from Ruthita. But a change was
      creeping over us almost imperceptibly, forming little rifts of reserve
      which widened. Walls of a new and more subtle kind were growing up about
      us, dividing us for a time from one another and from everybody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one holiday in which I became friendly with a butcher-boy. He
      was a guinea-pig fancier; I arranged to buy one from him for a shilling.
      My intention was to give it to Ruthita on her birthday. I told no one of
      my plan&mdash;it was to be a surprise. A little hutch was knocked up in
      the tool-shed which the old white hen had tenanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night before the birthday the butcher-boy came, and smuggled the
      little creature in at the gate. Next morning I wakened early. Ruthita was
      standing beside my bed in her long white night-gown, beneath which her
      rosy toes peeped out. When I had kissed her, she seemed surprised that I
      had no present for her. I became mysterious. &ldquo;You wait until I&rsquo;m dressed,&rdquo;
       I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slipping into my clothes I ran into the garden to get things ready. To my
      unspeakable astonishment when I looked into the hutch, I found three
      guinea-pigs, two of them very tiny, where only one had been the night
      before. I felt that something shameful and indelicate had happened.
      Exactly what I could not say, but something that I could not tell Ruthita.
      When she traced me down to the tool-shed, I drove her away almost angrily;
      I felt that I was secretly disgraced.
    </p>
    <p>
      That morning when the butcher-boy called for orders, I took him aside. I
      sold him back the three guinea-pigs for ninepence, and thought the loss of
      threepence a cheap price to pay to rid myself of such embarrassment. The
      butcher-boy grinned broadly and winked in a knowing manner. To me it was
      all very serious, and with a boy&rsquo;s pride I did not invite enlightenment. I
      took Ruthita out and let her choose her own present up to the value of
      ninepence. I lied to her, saying that that was what I had intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arguing by analogy from this experience, I gradually came to realize that
      all about me was a world of passion, the first boundaries of which I was
      just beginning to traverse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bantam, having no home to go to, would sometimes return with me to
      Pope Lane for the vacation; the Snow Lady was attracted by his freckled
      face and impudently upturned nose. In the early years he, Ruthita, and I
      would play together. Then, as we grew more boyish, we would play games in
      which she could not share. But at last a time came when I found that it
      was I who was excluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found that Ruthita and the Bantam had a way of going off and hiding
      themselves. It was quite evident that they had secrets which they kept
      from me. An understanding lay between them in which I could not share. I
      became irritable and began to watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      One summer evening after tea I could not find them, The gate into the Lane
      was unlatched; I followed. There was a deserted house no great way
      distant, standing shuttered in the midst of overgrown grounds. We had
      found a bar broken in the railings, and there the Bantam and I played
      highwaymen. Naturally I thought of this haunt first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creeping through the long grass I came upon them. The Bantam had his arm
      about Ruthita&rsquo;s waist. She was tossing back her hair; her face was
      radiant. I could only catch a glimpse of her sideways, but it came home to
      me that the qualities in her which, in my blindness, I had taken for
      granted, were beautiful and rare. As I watched, the Bantam kissed her. She
      drew back her head, glad and yet ashamed. I crept away with a strange
      sense of forlornness in my heart; they had stumbled across a pleasure of
      which I was ignorant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor little Ruthita!&mdash;it was short-lived. Hetty, having quarreled
      with the gardener, had not married. What I had seen, she also saw a few
      days later and told my father. He was very angry. I can see Ruthita now,
      with her long spindly legs and short skirts, standing up demurely to take
      her scolding. I listened to the scorching words my father spoke to her;
      the burden of his talk was that her conduct was unladylike. I came to her
      defense with the remark, &ldquo;But, father, she only did what I saw you and the
      Snow Lady doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night I went to bed supperless and I had no more pocket-money for a
      week. The Bantam&rsquo;s visit was cut short; he was bundled back to the Red
      House. I was sent down to Ransby to stay with my Grandmother Cardover. I
      have the fixed remembrance of Ruthita&rsquo;s eyes very red with weeping. The
      utmost comfort I could give her was the promise that I would carry
      messages of her eternal faithfulness to her lover on my return to school.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world had grown very complicated. Love was either wicked or stupid.
      Hetty had acted as though it was wicked when I caught her with John; my
      father, when I had caught him, as though it was stupid. Yet he was not
      ashamed of love now that he was married. I could not see why Ruthita
      should be so scolded for doing what her mother did every day.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V&mdash;THE AWAKENING
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t a distance I had
      been sorry for the Bantam, but at close quarters his hopeless passion for
      Ruthita bored me. On my return to the Red House he overwhelmed me with a
      flood of maudlin confessions. There was nothing pleased him better than to
      get me alone, so that he could outline to me his impossible plans for an
      early marriage. He talked of running away to sea and making his fortune in
      a distant land. It sounded all very easy. His only fear was that in his
      long absence Ruthita might be forced to marry some other fellow. &ldquo;Dante,&rdquo;
       he would say, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a lucky chap to have been always near her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This kind of talk irritated me, partly because I was jealous of an ecstasy
      which I could not understand, and partly because I had known Ruthita so
      many years that I thought I knew her exact value a good deal better than
      the Bantam. There was something very absurd, too, in the contrast between
      this gawky boy, with his downy face and clumsy hands, and these
      exaggerated expressions of sentiment. I began to avoid him; at that time I
      did not know why, but now I know it was because of the herd spirit which
      shuns abnormality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless he had stirred something latent within me. My days became
      haunted with alluring conjectures; beneath the cold formality of human
      faces and manners I caught glimpses of a boisterous ruffianly passion.
      Sometimes it would repel me, making me unspeakably sad; but more often it
      swept me away in a torrent of inexplicable riotous happiness. I had come
      to an age when, shut him up as you may in the garden of unenlightenment, a
      boy must hear from beyond the walls the pagan pipes and the dancing feet
      of Pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of nights I would lie awake, still and tense, reasoning my way forward and
      forward, out of the fairy tales of childhood into reality. Sometimes I
      would bury my face in my pillow, half glad and half ashamed of my strange,
      new knowledge. Now all the glory of the flesh in the Classics, which
      before had slipped by me when encountered as a schoolboy&rsquo;s task, burned in
      my brain with the vehement fire of immemorial romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Sneard had a terrifying sermon, which he was fond of preaching on
      Sunday evenings when the chapel was full of shadows. His heated face,
      startlingly illumined by the pulpit-lamps, would take on the furious
      earnestness of an accusing angel as he leant out towards us describing the
      spiritual tortures of the damned. He spoke in symbolic language of the
      causes which led up to damnation. Until quite lately I had wondered what
      in the world he could be driving at. His text was, &ldquo;Son of man, hast thou
      seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in
      his chambers of imagery?&rdquo; The grotesque unreality of likening a group of
      school-boys to the elders of Israel never occurred to me; I was too
      carried away by the reality of sin itself and the terror of what was said.
      When service was ended I would steal up the stone stairway to the
      dormitory in silence, almost fearful that my guilt might be betrayed by my
      shadow....
    </p>
    <p>
      It was summer-time. Those of us who professed an interest in entomology
      were permitted during the hour between prep and supper to rove the country
      with butterfly-nets. The results of these expeditions were given to the
      school natural history museum; most of the boys hunted in pairs. Things
      being as they were between myself and the Bantam, I preferred to go by
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      All day it had been raining. The sky was still damp with heavy clouds and
      the evening fell early. I slipped out into the cool wet dusk, eager to be
      solitary. Some boys were kicking a ball and called to me to come and play
      with them. In my anxiety not to be delayed, I doubled up my fists and ran.
      They followed in pursuit, but soon their shouts and laughter grew fainter,
      till presently I was alone in a dim, green world. The air was exquisitely
      fragrant with earth and flower smells. Far away between the trees of Eden
      Hill a watery sunset faded palely. Nearer at hand dog-roses and convolvuli
      glimmered in the hedges.
    </p>
    <p>
      I threw myself down in the dripping grass, lying full-length on my back,
      so that I could watch the stars struggle out between the edges of clouds.
      Oh, the sense of freedom and wideness, and the sheer joy of being at large
      in the world! I listened to the stillness of the twilight, which is a
      stillness made up of an infinity of tiny sounds&mdash;birds settling into
      their nests, trees whispering together, and flowers drawing closer their
      fragile petals to shut out the cold night air. I told myself that all the
      little creatures of the fields and hedgerows were tucking one another safe
      in bed. Then, as if to contradict me, the sudden passion of the
      nightingale wandered down the stairway of the silence, each note
      separately poignant, like glances of a lover who halts and looks back from
      every step as he descends. From far away the passion was answered, and
      again it was returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great White Admiral fluttered over my head. I picked up my net and was
      after it. So, in a second, the boy within me proved himself stronger than
      the man. But the butterfly refused to let me get near it and would never
      settle long enough for me to catch it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed from field to field, till at last it came to the cricket-ground
      and made a final desperate effort to escape me by flying over the hedge
      into the private garden of Sneard&rsquo;s house. His garden was forbidden
      territory, but the twilight made me bold to forget that. Breaking through
      the hedge I followed, running tiptoe down a path which ended in a
      summer-house. The White Admiral settled on a rosebush; I was in the act of
      netting it when I heard someone stirring. Standing in the doorway of the
      summerhouse was a girl about as tall as myself. We eyed one another
      through the dusk in silence. Her face was indistinct and in shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how you frightened me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Directly she spoke I knew that she was not Beatrice Sneard, as I had
      dreaded. Her voice was too friendly; it had in it the lazy caressing
      quality of a summer&rsquo;s afternoon when bees are humming in and out of
      flowers. Her way of pronouncing words was halting and slightly foreign. In
      after years I came to know just how much power of temptation her voice
      possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re not allowed in here,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but you needn&rsquo;t worry&mdash;I
      shan&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy in me prompted me to answer, &ldquo;You can tell if you care to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave a secret little laugh. &ldquo;But I shan&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After all my gallant imaginings of what I would do on a like occasion, I
      stood before her awkwardly, tongue-tied and ungracious&mdash;so far
      removed are dreams from reality. The White Admiral, tired with the long
      pursuit, still clung to the rose&rsquo;s petals. Across misty fields
      nightingales called, casting the love-spell, and the moon, in intermittent
      flashes, caused the dripping foliage to glisten.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rested her hand on my arm&mdash;such a small white hand&mdash;and drew
      me into the seclusion of the summerhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not afraid of girls, are you?&rdquo; she questioned, and then
      inconsequently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully lonely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a note of appeal in her tones, so I found my tongue and asked
      why she was lonely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I quarrel with Beatrice&mdash;we don&rsquo;t get on together. Do you
      know, she thinks all you boys are simply horrid persons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps we are,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Most people think that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she answered promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually my constraint left me. She had an easy kindness and assurance in
      her manner that I had never found in any other girl. She slipped her hand
      into mine; made bold by the darkness of the summer-house, I held it
      tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like you. I like you very much,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve never spoken to me before. Why should you like the?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her face to mine, so that our lips were quite near together. &ldquo;I
      suppose because I&rsquo;m a girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bell for supper began to ring. I pretended not to hear it. Through the
      roses across the lawn I saw Sneard stand in his study-window, struggling
      into his gown. Then the window became dark and I knew that he had gone to
      read evening prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bell is ringing,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t go, you&rsquo;ll get
      punished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s for your sake, I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pushed me gently from her. &ldquo;Go away now. If you get into trouble,
      you&rsquo;ll not be able to come back tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ran down the path with me as far as the hedge. The bell was at its
      last strokes, swinging slower and slower. At the hedge we halted. I knew
      what I wanted to do; my whole body ached to take her in my arms and kiss
      her. But something stronger than will&mdash;the habit of restraint&mdash;prevented.
      Some paces away on the other side of the hedge I remembered that I did not
      even know her name. Without halting I called back to her questioning, and
      as I ran the answer followed me through the shadows, &ldquo;Fiesole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the monitors had come up and the lights had been put out, I waited
      for an hour till all the dormitory was sleeping; then, very stealthily, I
      edged myself out of bed. Standing upright, I listened to make sure that I
      was undetected. I stole out into the corridor bare-foot. I feared to dress
      lest anyone should be aroused. In my long linen night-gown I tiptoed down
      the corridor, down the stairs, and entered the fifth-form class-room.
      Throwing up the window I climbed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      An English summer&rsquo;s night lay before me in all its silver splendor&mdash;huge
      shadows of trees, scented coolness of the air, and damp smoothness of turf
      beneath my tread. The exultation of life&rsquo;s bigness and cleanness came upon
      me. I knew now that it was right to be proud of the body and to love the
      body. Oh, why had it been left to a glimpse in the dusk of a young girl&rsquo;s
      face to teach me that? At a rush I had become possessed of all the codes
      of mediaeval chivalry. Every woman, however old or unpleasing, was for
      Fiesole&rsquo;s sake most perfect&mdash;a person to be worshiped; for in serving
      her I should be serving Fiesole. What a name to have! How all her
      perfectness was summed up in the beauty of those full vowel sounds, <i>Fi-es-sol-le</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I trespassed again in the garden. In the quiet of the rose-scented night I
      entered the summer-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far away the nightingales sang on. There were words to their chanting now
      and their song was no, longer melancholy. And these were the words as I
      heard them: &ldquo;<i>Fiesole&mdash;Fiesole&mdash;Fiesole. Love in the world.
      Love in the world. Glad&mdash;glad&mdash;glad.</i>&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI&mdash;WHAT IS LOVE?
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>y secret was too
      big and beautiful to keep to myself. There was no one I could tell it to
      save the Bantam. But the Bantam had grown shy of me; he knew that within
      myself I had been laughing at him. He turned away when I tried to catch
      his eye, and bent with unaccustomed diligence above his lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not till after lunch did I get a chance to approach him. All the other
      boys had changed into flannels and had hurried off to the cricket-nets. I
      wandered into the empty playground and there found him seated alone in a
      corner. His knees were drawn up so that his chin rested on them; in his
      eyes was a far-away sorrowful expression. I halted before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bantam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not look up, but I knew by the twitching of his hands that he had
      heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bantam, I&rsquo;ve got something to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly he turned his head. He was acting the part of Hamlet and I was
      vastly impressed. &ldquo;Is it about Ruthita?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partly. But it&rsquo;s happened to me too, Bantam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A genuine look of live-boy astonishment overspread his countenance. &ldquo;A
      girl!&rdquo; he ejaculated. &ldquo;But there ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t any about&mdash;unless you mean
      Pigtails.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pigtails was Beatrice Sneard, and I felt that an insult was being leveled
      at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you say that again, I&rsquo;ll punch your head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, so it is Pigtails.&rdquo; He rose to his feet lazily and began to take off
      his jacket. &ldquo;Come on and punch it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But a fight wasn&rsquo;t at all what I wanted. So I walked straight up to him
      with my hands held down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly ass, how could it be Pigtails? Do I look that sort? It&rsquo;s another
      girl. I came to you &rsquo;cause you&rsquo;re in love, and you&rsquo;ll understand.
      I&rsquo;ve been a beast to you&mdash;won&rsquo;t you be friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I held out my hand and he took it with surly defiance. I was too eager for
      sympathy, however, to be discouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s called Fiesole,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that beautiful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruthita&rsquo;s better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got gold hair with just a little&mdash;a little red in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prefer black.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not talking about Ruthita; I&rsquo;m telling you about Fiesole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; said the Bantam; &ldquo;you never do talk about Ruthita now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I walked away from him angrily in the direction I had taken on the
      previous evening. As I approached the nets I saw a little group of
      spectators. Then I made out the clerical figure of Sneard and the figure
      of Pigtails dressed in gray, and between them a slim white girl. Behind me
      I heard the pit-a-pat of running feet on the turf. The Bantam flung his
      arm about my shoulders, saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a beast and you&rsquo;ve been a
      beast; but we won&rsquo;t be beasts any longer.&rdquo; Then, following the direction
      of my eyes, &ldquo;What are you staring at? Is that her? My eye, she&rsquo;s a
      topper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He prodded me to go forward. When I showed reluctance, he used almost
      Fiesole&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;Why, surely, Dante, you ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t afraid of a girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was afraid, and always have been wherever my affections are concerned.
      But I wasn&rsquo;t going to own it just then. I let him slip his arm through
      mine, and we sauntered forward together. Through the soft summer air came
      the sharp <i>click</i> of the ball as it glanced off the bat, and the long
      cheer which followed as the wicket went down. Fiesole turned, clapping her
      hands, and our eyes met. Then she ceased to look at me; her gaze rested on
      the Bantam, while a half-smile played about her mouth. A pang of jealousy
      shot through me. With the instinctive egotism of the male, I felt that by
      the mere fact of loving her I had made her my property. However, Pigtails
      came to my rescue, for I saw her jolt Fiesole with her elbow; her shocked
      voice reached me, saying, &ldquo;Cousin Fiesole, whatever are you staring at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I tugged at the Bantam&rsquo;s sleeve and we turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My golly, but she is a ripper,&rdquo; he whispered....
    </p>
    <p>
      As the distance grew between us and her, he kept glancing across his
      shoulder and once halted completely to gaze back. I envied him his
      effrontery. My fate from the beginning has been to run away from the women
      I love&mdash;and then to regret it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had entered into another field and were passing a laburnum tree, when
      the Bantam drew up sharply. He pointed to its blossom all gold and yellow.
      &ldquo;The color of her hair,&rdquo; he said, and promptly threw himself under it,
      lying on his back, gazing up at its burning foliage. The sun filtered down
      through its leaves upon us, making fantastic patterns on our hands and
      faces. The field was tall in hay, ready for the cutting, so we had the
      boy&rsquo;s delight of being completely hidden from the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the color of her eyes?&rdquo; he asked presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know; it was dusk when I saw her. I expect it&rsquo;s the same as
      Ruthita&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Met her in Sneard&rsquo;s garden&mdash;Pigtails called her &lsquo;cousin&rsquo; just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s called Fiesole! Pretty name. How it suits her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not prettier than Ruthita,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat up and grinned at me. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;re you getting at? You wanted me to say
      all that half-an-hour ago in the playground; now I&rsquo;ve said it. I can think
      she&rsquo;s pretty, can&rsquo;t I, and still love Ruthita best?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you oughtn&rsquo;t to love her at all,&rdquo; I expostulated with a growing sense
      of indignant proprietorship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; explained the Bantam seriously, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re jealous. That&rsquo;s the
      way I felt about you when you told me that you weren&rsquo;t Ruthita&rsquo;s brother;
      I quite understand. But if I&rsquo;m to marry Ruthita, I shall be your
      brother-in-law. Sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t I? And if you marry Fiesole, she&rsquo;ll be my
      sister-inlaw. Won&rsquo;t she? Well then, I&rsquo;ve got a right to be pleased about
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took him at his word and told him everything that had happened and all
      that I knew about her. Continually he would break in with feverish words
      of surprise and flattery, leading me on still further to confess myself.
      In the magic world of that summer&rsquo;s afternoon no difficulties seemed
      insuperable. Married we could and would be. Parents and schoolmasters only
      existed for one purpose&mdash;to prevent boys and girls who fell in love
      from marrying: that was why grown-ups had all the money. In a natural
      state of society, where men lived in the woods, and wore skins, and
      carried clubs, these injustices would not happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we unbosomed ourselves, only understanding vaguely the immensities that
      love and marriage meant. Then the bell for four o&rsquo;clock school began
      calling and, like the slaves we were, we returned, on the run, to the Red
      House.
    </p>
    <p>
      We found that we were not the only persons to be inflamed by the beauty
      of, Fiesole. All the boys were talking about her. One of our chief fears
      was set at rest&mdash;her surname was not Sneard, but Cortona. Her father
      had been a famous Italian actor married to Sneard&rsquo;s sister, and both her
      parents fortunately were dead. She had quite a lot of money and had come
      from a convent at Tours, where she was, being, educated, to stay with her
      uncle on a visit of undetermined length or brevity. This news had all been
      gathered by the Cow, who had that curious faculty for worming out
      information which some boys possess. He had extracted it from the
      groundman, who had extracted it from Sneard&rsquo;s gardener, who had extracted
      it from Sneard&rsquo;s housemaid, with whom he was on more than friendly terms&mdash;so
      of course it was authentic.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening after prep I again stole out. The Bantam showed himself very
      impertinent&mdash;he wanted to come with me. I had great difficulty in
      persuading him that it wasn&rsquo;t necessary. I found Fiesole in the
      summer-house. She was subdued and wistful, and insisted on asking
      questions about that nice boy she had seen with me. I told her frankly
      that he was engaged to my sister, and gave her a graphic account of how my
      father had turned him out of Pope Lane. I fear I made him seem altogether
      too romantic. She made careful inquiries about the appearance of Ruthita,
      which I took as a sign of encouragement&mdash;a foreknowledge that sooner
      or later I intended to ask her to become one of my family. When the bell
      rang for prayers and we parted, I held her hand a little longer, but
      experienced my old reluctance in the matter of kissing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning fate played me a scurvy trick; I woke with a bad sore throat,
      due I suppose to my escapade of the night earlier, and was sent to the
      infirmary. On the evening of the day I came out, which was four days
      later, I was summoned after prep to report myself to the doctor. This made
      me late in getting to the summer-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell for prayers had commenced to ring as I got there. I was climbing
      through the hedge when I heard footsteps on the garden path. There were
      two children standing hushed amid the roses, the one with face tremulously
      uplifted, the other looking down with eager eyes. As I watched their lips
      met. It was impossible for me to stir without making my presence known.
      One of them came bolting into me, going out by the way I was entering. We
      rolled over and I recognized the Bantam. Fiesole, hearing the angry voices
      of two boys quarreling, ran. And so I got my first experience of the
      lightness of woman&rsquo;s affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if I was seeking a revenge, I got it. Before the end of the
      summer term Pigtails became suspicious, and discovered the Cow in the
      summer-house with the fickle Fiesole. The Cow, because he was a monitor,
      was expelled and I was appointed in his place&mdash;Mordecai and Haman
      after a fashion. Fiesole, on account of her kissing propensities, was
      regarded as a dangerous person and sent away. I was a grown man when next
      I met her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII&mdash;THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE SPUFFLER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was during the
      last week of the summer term, while I was convalescing from Fiesole&rsquo;s
      sudden exit and was beginning to forgive the Bantam his treachery, that
      the magic personality of George Rapson first flashed into my little world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was sitting listlessly at my desk one sunshiny morning. The window at my
      side was open, commanding a view of the school garden, the driveway
      leading through it, and beyond that of the sleepy village street. Below
      the window grew a bed of lavender whose fragrance, drifting in, made me
      forgetful of the book which lay before me and of the master at the
      black-board chalking up dull problems in algebra. I was dreaming as usual,
      telling myself a story of what I would do if old Sneard should pop his
      head inside the door and say, &ldquo;My dear Cardover, you have worked so well
      that I intend to make an example of you by giving you this day as a
      holiday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the master at the board turned round and jumped me into a
      realization of the present. &ldquo;Cardover, you will please stand up and repeat
      my explanation of this problem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stood up and gazed stupidly at the medley of signs and abbreviated
      formulae, hoping to discover some clue of reasoning in their apparent
      meaninglessness. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, sir, I wasn&rsquo;t attending.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought not. If you had been, you would have known that I have not
      explained it yet. You will come to me after class and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But his sentence was never ended. At that moment the head of every boy
      turned as one head; yes, and even the head of the master turned. Up the
      driveway came the sound of prancing hoofs, the soft crunch of wheels in
      the gravel, and cries of, &ldquo;Whoà, girl! Steady there, steady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Past the window flashed a high yellow dog-cart, drawn by a tandem of
      spirited chestnuts. A tiger in livery and top-hat sat behind with arms
      folded, superbly aware of his own magnificence. Between the wheels ran a
      Dalmatian, a plum-pudding dog as we used to call them. On the high
      front-seat were two men, equally gorgeous. The one who drove wore a large
      fawn coat with enormous pearl buttons, distinctly horsey in cut and
      fashion. On his head was a tall beaver hat. He was a massively built man
      and had the appearance of a sporting aristocrat. To make him more
      splendid, he was young, with a bronzed complexion, full red lips, and
      finely chiseled features. His companion looked like a Methodist parson,
      trying to pass as a racing gent. He was attired in a light tweed suit of a
      rather pronounced black and white check. On his head was a gray felt hat,
      and in his button-hole blazed a scarlet geranium. They were laughing in
      deep full-throated guffaws as they whizzed past, with the sun flashing on
      their wheels and harness. The tiger and the Dalmatian were the only solemn
      things about them. What was my surprise to have recognized in the second
      man a relative?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my uncle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even the master, so recently bent on my humiliation, seemed to hold his
      breath in regarding the nephew of so resplendent a person. Here was poetic
      justice with a vengeance. Most of the boys&rsquo; friends, if they were too rich
      to walk from the station when they came to visit them, crawled up the hill
      in a musty creaking cab, with hard wooden seats, and two or three handfuls
      of straw on the floor, more or less dirty. In the history of the Red House
      no boy&rsquo;s relative had dashed up to visit him with such a barbaric clatter
      and display of wealth. Ah, if Fiesole had been there to envy me, how she
      would have blamed herself for her falseness!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cardover, you may sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The master turned again to the black-board, forgetting the threatened
      penalty. The boys eyed me above the covers of their books, and awaited
      further developments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened and Sneard peered round on us shortsightedly. A pleased
      smile played about the corners of his diplomatic mouth. His happiness at
      receiving such distinguished callers seemed to have had an effect upon his
      hair, turning it to a yet more fiery red. Usually when he spoke he
      snapped, but now his tones were as fluty as he could make them with so
      little practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning to the master, &ldquo;Is Dante Cardover here?&rdquo; he inquired. When I was
      pointed out to him he said, &ldquo;Mr. George Rapson is here and with him your
      uncle, Mr. Spreckles. You may take a holiday, Dante, and go out with
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rose from my seat in an ecstasy of bewilderment. What under the sun had
      happened that old Sneard should call me Dante, and who was Mr. George
      Rapson? As I picked my way through the labyrinth of forms and desks;
      getting glimpses of my school-mates&rsquo; lengthened faces, I felt that I was
      taking the sunlight from the room by my good fortune as I left.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed Sneard to his study, which I had so often visited on such
      different errands. Even now as I crossed its threshold, I could not quite
      shake off my accustomed clammy dread. The Spuffler, catching sight of me,
      ran forward in his gayest manner. &ldquo;Ah, Dante, old chap, it&rsquo;s good to see
      you. Rapson&rsquo;s heard so much about you that he couldn&rsquo;t keep away any
      longer. &lsquo;Spreckles,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve got to introduce me. It&rsquo;s Dante,
      Dante, all day long. You can&rsquo;t talk of anyone else.&rsquo; So here we are.
      Rapson, this is my nephew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rapson grabbed me by the shoulder with a large white hand and gazed
      down on me. There was a jolly-dog air about him combined with a big
      healthy strength, which made one both like and fear him from the first.
      And there was so much of him to like; he was over six foot in height and
      proportionately built in breadth. &ldquo;Hm! Dante. Glad to meet you. Let&rsquo;s get
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sneard wanted me to put on my Sunday suit, but Mr. Rapson wouldn&rsquo;t hear of
      it. &ldquo;Hated clothes when I was a kid. Still think we ought to go naked. Let
      him be as he is. He&rsquo;s got nothing to spoil and therefore&rsquo;ll enjoy
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting for a reply, he nodded to Sneard, heaved his great
      shoulders through the doorway, so down the hall and out on to the steps
      where the tiger was holding the horses&rsquo; heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just like Rapson,&rdquo; my uncle said. &ldquo;Masterful fellow. Makes up his mind
      and then goes ahead. Good-day, Mr. Sneard. Oh, yes, we&rsquo;ll take care of him
      and bring him back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They took me up in front beside them; the whip cracked and the tiger
      sprang away from the leader. Off we sped, down the hill and into the
      valley, winding in and out of overgrown lanes where we had to duck our
      heads to avoid the boughs; then out again with fields on either side of
      us, up hill and down dale never slackening, with the wind on our cheeks
      and the sun in our faces. Mr. Rapson&rsquo;s attention was completely taken up
      with his driving; it needed to be, for he swung round corners and squeezed
      between farm-wagons in outrageously reckless fashion. I watched his strong
      masterful hands, how they gathered in the reins and forced the horses to
      obedience. My eyes wandered up him and rested on his face: the face of a
      man a little over thirty, calm and yet when stern almost cruelly
      determined, with a shapely beak of a Roman nose planted squarely in the
      middle of it&mdash;a sign-post to his purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I glanced at my uncle with his fashionable checks and scarlet
      geranium. I remembered that my grandmother called him the Spuffler, and
      wondered what she would call him now, could she see him. That nervous air
      he had had, of at once asserting and apologizing for himself with a
      pitiful display of bluster, had vanished. He carried himself with the
      jaunty confidence of a middle-aged gentleman unsubdued by the world&mdash;one
      who knew how to be dignified when necessary, but who preferred at present
      to relax. Above all he conveyed the impression of one beautifully fond of
      life&rsquo;s simple pleasures and quietly composed in a happy self-respect. What
      had done it? Was it George Rapson, or had he at last had success with one
      of his poultry experiments?
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he guessed some of the inquiries that were running through my
      head, for, as I crouched near him in the little space allotted me on our
      high up perch, he squeezed my hand, hinting at some great secret, for the
      telling of which we must be alone by our two selves.
    </p>
    <p>
      With foam flying from the horses&rsquo; mouths we entered Richmond and glittered
      down those quaint and narrow streets, which have always seemed to me more
      like streets of a seaport than of an inland town. We turned a corner; full
      before us drifted up the long and shadowy quiet of the Thames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rapson refused to be sociable until he had seen to the rubbing down
      and stabling of his horses; so we two wandered off together along the
      miniature quays, where boatmen with a deep-sea sailor&rsquo;s swagger pulled
      clay pipes from their mouths and wished us a cheerfully mercenary
      &ldquo;Good-mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My curiosity was inarticulate with a multitude of crowding questions. I
      couldn&rsquo;t make my choice which to ask first. I watched the swans sail in
      and out the tethered boats, and racked my brain for words. Then I blurted
      out, &ldquo;What does it all mean, Uncle Obad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes filled with tears. &ldquo;My boy, it means success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I mumbled something typically boylike and inadequate about being &ldquo;jolly
      glad.&rdquo; He slipped his arm through mine with that endearing familiarity he
      had, as though I were a man. He was too excited to sit down, so we
      strolled along the quays, under the creeper-covered redbrick walls of the
      houses, and out of Richmond along the open river-bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one ever believed that I&rsquo;d do it, Dante. I don&rsquo;t think you did
      yourself. They all said, &lsquo;Oh, Spreckles! Ha, the fellow who twiddles his
      thumbs while his wife works!&rsquo; They didn&rsquo;t say it to my face&mdash;they
      didn&rsquo;t dare. But that was what they thought about me. I seemed a failure&mdash;a
      good-natured incompetent. Even people who liked me felt ashamed of me&mdash;-I
      mean people who were dear to me, living in the same house. Women want
      their husbands to measure up to the standards of other men. It&rsquo;s natural&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t blame &rsquo;em. But, you know, I never had a chance, old chap&mdash;never
      seemed to find my right kind of work. I couldn&rsquo;t do little things well.
      I&rsquo;m one of those imperial men who need something big to bring the best out
      of&rsquo; &rsquo;em. And now I&rsquo;ve got it&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got it, Dante.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I caught his excitement, and begged him to tell me what this wonderful
      something was that had so suddenly transformed him from a nobody into a
      powerful person. I felt sure he was powerful, apart from anything he said,
      for he radiated opulence. He halted in the middle of the tow-path,
      gripping me by the shoulders, laughing into my face and bidding me guess.
      I guessed everything possible and impossible. Losing patience, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      diamond mines,&rdquo; he burst out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did you get &rsquo;em, Uncle Obad, and where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an instant I had a wild vision of men with pickaxes, shovels, and
      miners&rsquo; lamps, digging down into the bowels of the Christian Boarding
      House.
    </p>
    <p>
      We seated ourselves on the bank with legs dangling above the water, and he
      told me. It seemed that Mr. George Rapson was the cause of this meteoric
      rise to prosperity. In April he had come to stay at Charity Grove as an
      ordinary paying-guest. From the first he was extraordinary and had amazed
      them with his wealth-his horses, his clothes, his friends, and his lavish
      manners. Most of his? fellow boarders were struggling young men, who
      earned two pounds a week in the City and paid twenty-five shillings for
      their keep and lodging. On the start they only knew that he was a South
      African, holiday-making in England. Little by little he let out that he
      was interested in diamond mines, and later that he owned <i>The Ethiopian</i>,
      one of the most promising properties of its kind in the world. The more
      communicative he became, the more surprised they were that he should make
      his head-quarters at a Christian Boarding House. There seemed no reason
      why he should not pay a higher price and enjoy the advantages of a secular
      environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night he took my uncle into his room, locked the door, and let the cat
      out of the bag. It was my uncle and his personality that had attracted
      him. He had seen his name as secretary to so many thriving philanthropic
      societies that he had been led to appreciate his worth as an organizer. He
      wanted his help. He had come to England to unload a number of shares in <i>The
      Ethiopian</i> diamond mines, but it had to be done quietly and without
      advertisement. He had a number of unscrupulous enemies in the mining world
      who wanted to merge his property with theirs. They had tried to crowd him
      out in various ways&mdash;once by bringing about a law-suit to dispute his
      title to his holdings. If they should get wind that shares in <i>The
      Ethiopian</i> were to be bought in the open market, they would buy up
      every share in sight in an effort to gain control. Therefore it was
      necessary that business should be carried on in a private manner, and as
      far as possible through channels of personal friendship rather than those
      of the City and the Stock Exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had studied my uncle carefully and was convinced that he was just the
      man for the work. He proposed giving him a salary of one thousand pounds a
      year to act as his English agent, and a five-per-cent commission on all
      sales of shares that he was instrumental in effecting. His chief service
      was to consist in supplying lists of names and addresses of the moneyed
      religious public, and in applying his influence to the attracting of
      purchasers. The lists were of course to be culled mainly from the
      contributors to the charitable societies of which he was secretary. In
      fact, what the proposal amounted to, as I see it now, was that my uncle&rsquo;s
      integrity, well-known among religious circles, was to guarantee the worth
      of the shares.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a close secret, Dante,&rdquo; my uncle said. &ldquo;Rapson won&rsquo;t let me tell
      anyone, not even your Aunt Lavinia, the basis of our understanding. But I
      had to tell somebody; happiness isn&rsquo;t happiness when you keep its reason
      to yourself. So I&rsquo;ve told you, because we&rsquo;ve had so many secrets
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We sat on, quite forgetful of time, watching the sleepy flowing of the
      river, building castles in the air. Last month they had declared their
      half-yearly dividend and it had amounted to twenty per cent. Since then
      the sale of shares had quickened enormously. Why, there was one morning&rsquo;s
      mail when my uncle&rsquo;s commissions alone had amounted to fifty pounds. Think
      of that&mdash;and it was only the beginning! Then we commenced to reckon
      how much he would have in five years, if his commissions amounted always
      to fifty pounds a morning, and he made a rule to spend nothing but his
      salary. It was the old childish game which had first made us chummy, of so
      many hens laying so many eggs, and how much would we have at the end of a
      twelvemonth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could afford to joke now concerning the penury of his lean years before
      the great Rapson had put in an appearance. He even made fun of his own <i>spuffing</i>,
      and laughed as he told me how much economy those odd shillings and
      half-crowns, which he used to give me in such a large manner, had cost
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all over now,&rdquo; he said cheerfully, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m going to be an
      important man. People are beginning to look up to me already. Who knows?&mdash;one
      day I may enter Parliament. I&rsquo;m moving in a different social set&mdash;Rapson&rsquo;s
      friends. He&rsquo;s very well-connected. They&rsquo;re a little gay and larky, you
      know; your Aunt Lavinia don&rsquo;t quite know what to make of &rsquo;em.
      She&rsquo;ll get over that. Oh, but it&rsquo;s a big new world for me, Dante, and
      there&rsquo;s heaps of things to do in it that I never knew about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On our way back the great George Rapson himself met us, and we found that
      we&rsquo;d been gone an hour. He told us that he&rsquo;d ordered lunch at a little
      inn, called <i>The White Cross</i>&mdash;one which hung over the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      How proud I was to walk beside him as we re-entered Richmond! Everyone
      turned to stare after him as he passed, with his long fawn coat open and
      flapping, his easy rollicking laugh, his great height and distinguished
      presence. And I, Dante Cardover, was by way of being the friend of such a
      man! The gates of romance were indeed opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The White Cross Inn</i> had separate balconies, built out from each of
      its second-story windows. In one of these our table was set. The little
      tiger helped the maid of the inn to wait upon us. And what a meal we had!&mdash;salmon
      and salad and fowl, stuffed veal and pine-apple, dates, almonds, and
      raisins&mdash;everything that a boy could ask to have. Up the walls of the
      inn climbed rambler roses and tumbled over the sides of the balcony.
      Beneath us lay the river, like a silver snake, lazily uncurled, sunning
      itself in great green meadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is to be your day, Dante,&rdquo; Mr. Rapson said. &ldquo;We brought some of
      these things from London because we knew you liked, &rsquo;em. You discovered
      your Uncle Obad before I did, and when no one else had. He&rsquo;s told me all
      about it. Here&rsquo;s your very good health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tiger, who had been drawing the cork out of a large green bottle about
      half as tall as himself, now poured out a golden foamy liquid. I found one
      glass of it had the same care-freeing effect that the holding of Fiesole&rsquo;s
      hand in the summer-house had had. I felt myself at ease in the world, and
      began to speak of the Reverend Robert Sneard as &ldquo;jolly old Sneard,&rdquo; and of
      all people who had authority over me with tolerant contempt. I gazed back
      from the security of my temporary Canaan, and gave my entertainers a
      whimsical account of my perilous journey through the wilderness of
      boyhood. It was wonderful even to myself how suddenly my shyness had
      vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rapson seemed highly amused. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do, young&rsquo;un,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then little, by little, he began to speak of Africa&mdash;-the dust, the
      Kaffirs, and the wide, parched veldt. He spoke of adventures with lions
      far up in the interior, and of how he had once been an ivory-hunter before
      he struck it lucky in the south. &ldquo;I ran away from home when I was a
      youngster of twenty and all because of a girl.&rdquo; He nodded at me wisely
      across the table, &ldquo;Keep clear of the girlies, they&rsquo;re the devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought of Fiesole and inquired if some girls weren&rsquo;t quite attractive
      devils. My uncle looked shocked in a genial fashion at this very free use
      of a forbidden word&mdash;the fear of Aunt Lavinia purged his vocabulary
      even when she was absent. But Mr. Rapson went red in the face and smacked
      his hands together, laughing loudly. &ldquo;Of course they&rsquo;re attractive; else
      how&rsquo;d they tempt us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A punt, which had stolen up beneath our balcony, now caught his attention.
      A girl in a gown of flowered muslin, with a broad pink sash about her
      waist, was standing in the stern. She was alone, and all the river formed
      a landscape for her daintiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rapson stared hard at her; her back was towards us. &ldquo;Seem to know her
      hair,&rdquo; he muttered. He half rose. &ldquo;By George, it&rsquo;s Kitty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaning far out over the balcony he called to her impulsively, &ldquo;Kitty!
      Kitty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Very leisurely she lifted up to him a small flushed face, all laughter and
      naughtiness, and waved her hand. She was as pretty as love and a summer&rsquo;s
      day could make a woman&mdash;but I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be old enough to
      observe such things as that.
    </p>
    <p>
      She brought her punt in to the bank, while Mr. Rapson went down to help
      her out. When he gave her his hand to steady her, she kept it in hers. As
      she glanced mischievously up at him I heard her say, &ldquo;Why, George, you
      terror, who&rsquo;d have thought of meeting you here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He whispered something to her with a frown; she dropped him a mocking
      courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he brought her up on to the balcony, he introduced her as his cousin
      Kitty. She bowed to us with a roguish grace, clinging close to his arm.
      &ldquo;Now, Kitty,&rdquo; he said, freeing himself, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got to behave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that my uncle was looking at her in a puzzled manner, she took the
      center of the stage without embarrassment, explaining, &ldquo;Georgie and I are
      very old friends and I&rsquo;ve not seen him, oh, for ages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they had told her how they happened to be there and that it was my
      day, and that they had stolen me away from my lessons, she swung round on
      me with a kind of rapture. &ldquo;Oh, what darlings to do that! And what a nice
      boy!&rdquo; Without further ado she patted my face and kissed me. It was a new
      sensation. I blushed furiously, and was both pleased and abashed. &ldquo;You may
      be older than I am,&rdquo; I thought; &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re only a girl. In three years I
      could marry you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was like a happy little dog in a meadow; never still, sending up birds&mdash;following
      nothing and chasing everything. In her conversation she gamboled about and
      never ceased gamboling. She didn&rsquo;t sit quietly like the Snow Lady and all
      the other ladies of my acquaintance, putting in a word now and then, but
      letting the men do the talking. She made everybody look at her&mdash;perhaps,
      because she was so well worth looking at. Even before she had kissed me I
      was in love with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rapson seemed a little nervous, and she appeared to delight in his
      fear of her daring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Georgie&rsquo;s always had a passion for me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;though he won&rsquo;t own
      it.&rdquo; Then suddenly, seeing the troubled expression on his face, &ldquo;How much
      has the poor dear told you about himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wriggled out of me something of the story of his doings. She eyed him
      archly from under her big hat and, when I had ended, leant across the
      table so their faces nearly met. &ldquo;How many lions did my Georgie kill in
      Africa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet, you little devil,&rdquo; he laughed, seizing her by the hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The employment of that forbidden word set me wondering whether this was
      the girl for love of whom he first went wandering. But she looked too
      young for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went into her punt and drifted down the river with the current. She
      played the madcap all the way, speaking to him often in baby language. He
      seemed to be amused by it, as a St. Bernard might be amused by the
      impertinence of a terrier. When she got too bold he would hold her hands
      until she was quiet, overpowering her with his great strength much the
      same as he did his horses. Then she would turn her attentions to me for a
      time, and I would make believe to myself she was Fiesole. My uncle looked
      on like a benevolent Father Christmas, dignified and smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dusk was settling when we started on the return journey. We found that we
      had drifted further than we had intended. Mr. Rapson took the pole and did
      the punting. Miss Kitty sang to him, she said to encourage him. I think it
      must have been then that I first heard <i>Twickenham Ferry</i>. She had to
      leave off part way through the last verse I remember. She said that the
      mist from the river choked her; but I, lying on the cushions beside her,
      somehow gathered the impression that she was nearly crying. When she broke
      down, under cover of darkness I got my hand into hers, and then she
      slipped her arm about me. After that she was very subdued and silent. My
      uncle fell off to sleep, and Mr. Rapson kept his face turned away from us,
      busy with his punting. I wondered if, after all, Miss Kitty was happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was night when we arrived. She insisted on parting with us at the
      landing, saying that her houseboat was just across the river and she could
      take the punt home quite well unaccompanied. We had said good-by and were
      walking along the quay, when Rapson left us and ran back. I saw him come
      close and bend over her. They seemed to be whispering together. Then she
      pushed out into the river; the lights of the town held her for a time;
      darkness closed in behind her and she vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the drive back to the Red House I grew drowsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to keep my eyes open, but even the soft moonlight seemed dazzling.
      The meadows and tall trees stealing by, ceased to stand out separate, but
      became a blur. The sharp <i>trit-trot, trit-trot</i> of the horses&rsquo; hoofs
      on the hard macadam road lulled me by their monotonous regularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came to myself I heard my uncle saying, &ldquo;I like that little cousin
      of yours, Rapson; she&rsquo;s charming and different from any woman that I ever
      met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daresay she is,&rdquo; Rapson answered, dryly; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve led such a sheltered
      life. Of course she isn&rsquo;t my cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is she, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a nymph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A nymph! You have the better of me there. That&rsquo;s a classical allusion, no
      doubt. I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, papa,&rdquo; Mr. Rapson said cheerfully; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you would
      understand. It&rsquo;s just as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he commenced speaking to his horses. &ldquo;So, girl! Steady there!
      Steady!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rubbed my eyes, and saw that we were ascending Eden Hill.

      CHAPTER VIII&mdash;MONEY AND HAPPINESS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>eep down in their
      secret hearts all the Spuffler&rsquo;s relations had felt that his permanent
      failure to get on in the world was a kind of disgrace to themselves. They
      resented it, but as a rule kept quiet about it &ldquo;for the sake of poor
      Lavinia.&rdquo; My aunt was always &ldquo;poor Lavinia,&rdquo; when mentioned by her family.
      Before: strangers, needless to say, they helped him to keep up his
      pretense of importance and spoke of him with respect. But the thought that
      a man who had intermarried with them, should have lowered his wife to the
      keeping of a boarding-house rankled. Even as a child I was conscious that
      my close attachment to my uncle Obad was regarded with disapprobation. He
      was the Ishmael of our tribe.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first none of his relatives would believe in his mushroom prosperity.
      Perhaps, they did not want to believe in it; it would entail the sacrifice
      of life-long prejudices. They pooh-poohed it as the most extravagant
      example of his fantastic spuffling. On my return home for the summer
      holidays I very soon became aware of an atmosphere of half-humorous
      contempt whenever his name was mentioned. Once when I took up the cudgels
      for him, declaring that he was really a great man, the Snow Lady patted my
      hand gently, calling me &ldquo;a blessed young optimist.&rdquo; My father, who rarely
      lost his temper, told me I was speaking on a subject concerning which I
      was profoundly ignorant.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a visit to Charity Grove I was grieved to find that even Aunt Lavinia
      was skeptical. Despite the jingling of money in my uncle&rsquo;s pockets, she
      insisted on living in the old proud hand-to-mouth fashion, making the
      spending capacity of each penny go its furthest. Her house was still
      understaffed in the matter of servants&mdash;servants who could be
      procured at the lowest wages. She still did her shopping in the
      lower-class districts, where men cried their wares on the pavement beneath
      flaring naphtha-lamps and slatternly women elbowed your ribs and mauled
      everything with dirty hands before they purchased. Here housekeeping could
      be contrived on the smallest outlay of capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Obad might go to fashionable tailors; she clothed herself in black,
      because it wore longest and could be turned. She listened to his latest
      optimisms a little wearily with a sadly smiling countenance, as a mother
      might listen to the plans for walking of a child hopelessly crippled. She
      had heard him speak bravely so many, many times, and had been
      disappointed, that she had permanently made up her mind that she would
      have to go on earning the living for both of them all her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she loved him as well as a woman could a man for whom she was only
      sorry; she was constantly on the watch to defend him from the
      disapprobation of the world. But she refused ever again to be beguiled
      into believing that he would take his place with other men. So, when he
      told her that they didn&rsquo;t need to keep on the boarding-house, she scarcely
      halted long enough in her work to listen to him. And when he said that he
      could now afford her a hundred pounds for dress, she bent her head lower
      to hide a smile, for she didn&rsquo;t want to wound him. And when he brought her
      home a diamond bracelet, she tried to find out where it had been purchased
      in order that she might return it on the quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually, however, she began to be persuaded that this time it wasn&rsquo;t all
      bluster. The gallantry of his attitude towards herself was the
      unaccountable element. Not so long ago it had been she who was the man
      about the house, and he had been a kind of grown-up boy. Once she had
      allowed him to kiss her; now he kissed her masterfully as by right of
      conquest. He had become a man at last, after halting at the hobbledehoy
      stage for fifty years. He treated her boldly as a lover, striving to draw
      out her womanhood. He was making up the long arrears of affection which,
      up to this time, he had not felt himself worthy to display.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening in the garden he tore the bandage of doubt from her eyes. I
      was there when it happened. We were down in the paddock, the home of the
      fowls, where so many of our dreams had taken place. The gaunt London
      houses to the right of us were doing their best to shut out the sunset.
      Aunt Lavinia began to wonder how much the little hay-crop would fetch this
      year. She was disappointed because it had grown so thin, and there seemed
      no promise of rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter, my dear,&rdquo; said my uncle cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obad, how can you say that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pressed up to her flushing like a boy, placing his arms about her and
      lifting her face. &ldquo;Lavinia, are you never going to trust me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sudden tenderness and reproach in his voice stabbed her heart into
      wakefulness. When she spoke, her words came like a cry: &ldquo;Oh, Obad, how I
      wish I could believe it true this time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is true, my dearest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stole away, and did not see them again till an hour later when they
      wandered by me arm-in-arm through the wistful twilight. Within a week I
      knew that she had accepted his prosperity as a fact, for he gave her a
      blue silk dress and she wore it. But he had harder work in getting her to
      give up the boarding-house. His great argument was that Rapson advised it&mdash;it
      would advance their social standing. She fenced and hesitated, but finally
      promised on the condition that he was still succeeding in November.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think it must have been the news of her surrender that sapped the last
      foundation of my father&rsquo;s skepticism. At any rate, shortly after this,
      when my uncle by special invitation came over to Pope Lane, he was given
      one of my father&rsquo;s best cigars as befitted a rich relative. The best glass
      and silver were put out. We all had unsoiled serviettes and observed
      uncomfortable company manners. In the afternoon he was carried off to my
      father&rsquo;s study and remained there till long past the tea-hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later my father told me the subject of their discussion.. By dint of hard
      saving he had put by two thousand pounds for planting me out in the world,
      part of which was to pay for my Oxford education. Having heard of that
      half-yearly twenty-per-cent dividend which the <i>Ethiopian</i> shares had
      paid and that they were still being issued privately, at par value, he was
      inclined to entrust his money to my uncle, if he could prove the
      investment sound. If the mines were as good as they appeared to be, he
      would get four hundred pounds a year in interest&mdash;which would make
      all the difference to our ease of life. There was another consultation;
      the next thing I knew the important step had been taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      All our power of dreaming now broke loose. It became our favorite pastime
      to sit together and plan how we would spend the four hundred pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s an income in itself,&rdquo; my father would exclaim; &ldquo;I shall be
      freed forever from the drudgery of hack-work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the Snow Lady would say, &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ll be able to turn your mind to the
      really important things of life&mdash;the big books which you&rsquo;ve always
      hoped to write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Ruthita would sidle up to him in her half-shy way, and rub her cheek
      against his face, saying nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wonderful kindliness nowadays entered into all our domestic relations.
      My father&rsquo;s weary industry, which had sent us all tiptoeing about the
      house, began to relax. Even for him work lost something of its sacredness
      now that money was in sight. He no longer frowned and refused to look up
      if anyone trespassed into his study. On the contrary, he seemed glad of
      the excuse for laying aside his pen and discussing what place in the whole
      wide world we should choose, when we were free to live where we liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be somewhere in Italy&mdash;Florence, perhaps. For years it had
      been his unattainable dream to live among olive-groves of the Arno valley.
      We read up guide-books and histories about it. Soon we were quite familiar
      with the Pitti Palace, the Ponte Vecchio, and the view from the Viale dei
      Colli at sundown. These and many places with beautiful and large-sounding
      names, became the stock-in-trade of our conversation. And the brave,
      looked-down-on Spuffler was the faery-godmother who had made these dreams
      realities.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tangible proof of the promised change in our financial status was
      experienced by myself on my return to school in a more liberal allowance
      of pocket-money. As yet it was only a promised change, for the half-yearly
      dividend would not be declared until January, and would not be paid till a
      month later.
    </p>
    <p>
      What one might call &ldquo;a reflected proof&rdquo; came when we went over to spend
      Christmas with Uncle Obad at Chelsea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Aunt Lavinia had succumbed to her good fortune. The Christian
      Boarding House had been abandoned and a fine old house had been rented,
      standing nearly at the corner of Cheyne Row, looking out across the river
      to Battersea.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Christmas Eve my uncle&rsquo;s carriage came to fetch us. That was a surprise
      in itself. It was his present to Aunt Lavinia, all brand new&mdash;a roomy
      brougham, with two gray horses, and a coachman in livery. From this it
      will be seen that he had not kept his bargain with himself, made that day
      at Richmond, to live only on his salary.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight fall of snow was on the ground; across London we drove, the
      merriest little family in all that shopping crowd. We had scarcely pulled
      up against the pavement and had our first peep of the fine big house, when
      the front-door flew open, letting out a flood of light which rippled to
      the carriage like a golden carpet unrolled across white satin.
    </p>
    <p>
      There stood Uncle Obad, frock-coated and glorious, with Aunt Lavinia
      beside him, dressed all in lavender&mdash;not at all the prim,
      businesslike little woman, half widow, half hospital nurse, of my earliest
      recollection. She was as beaming and excited as a young girl, and greeted
      the Snow Lady by throwing her arms about her and whispering, &ldquo;Oh, doesn&rsquo;t
      it seem all too good to be true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Snow Lady kissed her gaily on both cheeks, saying, &ldquo;True enough, my
      dear. At any rate, Obad&rsquo;s carriage was very real.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How changed we were from the solemn polite personages who had considered
      it a point in our favor that we knew how to bottle our emotions. We
      laughed and rollicked, and made quite poor jokes seem brilliant by the
      sparkle with which we told or received them. And all this was done by
      money; in our case, merely by the promise of money! When a boy remembered
      what we all had been, it was a transformation which called for reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      My uncle with his jolly rich-relative manner was the focus-point of our
      attentions. Aunt Lavinia and, in fact, we all felt flat whenever he went
      out of the room. She followed after him like a little dog, with dumb
      admiring eyes, waiting to be petted. She told the Snow Lady that she
      couldn&rsquo;t blame herself enough and could never make it up to him, for
      having lived with him in the same house all those years without having
      discovered his goodness. Then, as ladies will, they kissed for the
      twentieth time and did a little glad crying together.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the stern grayness, which comes of a too frequent pondering on a
      diminishing bank-account, had vanished from the faces of our elders.
      Ruthita and I looked on and wondered. A great house had something to do
      with it, and heavy carpets, and wide fire-places, and fine shiny
      furniture, but underlying it all was money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christmas Eve I was awakened by the playing of waits outside my window. I
      looked out at the broad black river, with the ropes of stars, which were
      the lights of bridges, flung across it. And I looked at the untrodden
      snow, stretching far down the Embankment, gleaming and shadowy, making
      London seem a far-away, forgotten country. Then fumbling in the darkness,
      I looked in my stocking and drew out a slip of paper. By the light of a
      match, I discovered it to be a check from my aunt and uncle for fifty
      pounds. Comparing notes in my night-gown with Ruthita next morning, I
      found that she had another for the same amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, but that was something like a Christmas! Never a twenty-fifth of
      December comes round but I remember it. My father summed it all up when he
      said, &ldquo;Well, Obad, now you&rsquo;ve struck it lucky, you certainly know how to
      be generous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He certainly did, and proved amply that only poverty had prevented him in
      former days from being the best loved man in the family. Only one person
      roused more admiration than my uncle, and that was Mr. Rapson. My father
      had never met him, so he had been invited to the Christmas dinner. At the
      last moment he had excused himself, saying that he had an unavoidable
      engagement with a lady. However, he turned up late in the evening with
      Miss Kitty on his arm and a fur-coat on his back. Somehow they both seemed
      articles of clothing; he wore them with such perfect assurance, as though
      they were so much a part of himself. In the hall he took off his fur-coat,
      and then he had only Miss Kitty to wear.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was awe-inspiring to see the deference that was paid him and the ease
      with which he accepted every attention. My father, with the sincerest
      simplicity, almost thanked him to his face for selling him <i>The
      Ethiopian</i> shares.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course he had to tell his lion-stories and how he went hunting ivory in
      Africa. My uncle trotted him about as though he were a horse, reminding
      him of all his paces. Mr. Rapson was <i>his</i> discovery&mdash;<i>his</i>
      property. We all sat round and hero-worshiped. Miss Kitty seemed
      overwhelmed by the greatness of the house and the general luxury.
    </p>
    <p>
      She appeared particularly shy of the ladies. After she had gone they
      declared her to be a dumb, doll-like little creature, with her quiet eyes
      and honey-colored hair. I sniggered, and they said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter
      with the boy? Why are you gurgling, Dante?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was thinking of another occasion, when she was neither dumb nor
      doll-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, quite contrary to her behavior at Richmond, she remained almost
      motionless on the chair in which Mr. Rapson had placed her, looking like a
      beautiful obedient piece of jewelry, waiting till her owner got ready to
      claim her. Only at parting did she show me any sign of recollection and
      then, while all eyes were occupied with Mr. Rapson, she whispered, &ldquo;You
      were good to me at Richmond. I don&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We stayed with my uncle four days. To us children it was a kind of tragedy
      when we left. &ldquo;We must do this every year,&rdquo; my uncle said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t in Florence,&rdquo; my father replied gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going back to school this time was a sore trial&mdash;it meant moving out
      of the zone of excitement. It seemed that every day something new must
      happen; and then there was so much to talk about. However, I got my
      pleasure another way&mdash;by the things I let out at school, with a boy&rsquo;s
      natural boastfulness, about my uncle. I found myself, what I had always
      desired to be, genuinely and extremely popular. Money again! I let them
      know that they would probably only have the privilege of my society for a
      little while as, in all likelihood, I should be living in Florence next
      year.
    </p>
    <p>
      This term two events happened, intimately related to one another in their
      effect upon my career, though at the time no one could have suspected any
      connection between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Zion, the Creature&rsquo;s sister, had certainly got more crazy in the
      years that had elapsed since I first met her. The winter was a heavy one
      and the snow fell far into February; yet nothing could restrain her, short
      of an asylum, from wandering about in the bleakest weather all over the
      countryside. Sometimes she would stay out far into the night, and on
      several occasions the Creature and I had to go out and search for her. I
      have seen her pass me five miles from home, riding on her little ass,
      talking to herself, all unaware of anything around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a temptation to the village-boys, and they would frequently
      torment her. The antagonism between the Red House and the village ran
      high. In a sense she was school property; we would make a chance of
      rescuing her an excuse for a free-fight. This meant that when the enemy
      found her alone, they took the opportunity of displaying their spite.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fourteenth of February she had been out all day. No one had seen
      her; by nightfall she had not returned. The Creature got permission to
      have me go out with him to hunt for her. It was necessary that someone
      should go with him because he was short-sighted. We investigated all her
      favorite haunts, but found not a trace of her. We inquired of farmers and
      travelers on the road, but heard nothing satisfactory. If she had gone by
      field-routes this was not remarkable, for all the country was covered with
      snow. Her white draped figure against the white landscape made it easy for
      her to escape observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor old Creature was getting worried; we had been three hours
      searching and hadn&rsquo;t got a clue. I did my best to cheer him, and at last
      proposed that we should return to his cottage as sometimes the donkey had
      brought her back of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the point where we then stood our shortest route lay cross-country
      through a wood, skirting a little dell. Under the trees it was very dark
      although the moon was shining, for the trees grew close together. We were
      passing by the dell when I happened to look aside. The moonlight, falling
      across it, showed me something standing there. I asked the Creature to
      wait while I went and examined it. As I got nearer, I saw it was alive;
      then I recognized Lady Zion&rsquo;s donkey. It had halted over what appeared to
      be a drift of snow. On coming closer I saw that it was Lady Zion herself.
      Something warned me not to call her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bending down, I turned her over and drew the straggling hair from off her
      face. There was a red gash in her forehead and red upon the snow. By the
      fear that seized me when I touched her, I knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming back to the Creature I told him it was nothing&mdash;I had been
      mistaken. At the school-house I made an excuse to leave him while he went
      on to the cottage. When he was out of sight I ran panic-stricken to
      Sneard&rsquo;s study and told him. The two of us, without giving the alarm,
      returned to the wood and brought her home. The Creature was just setting
      out again when we reached the cottage. By the limp way in which she hung
      across the donkey&rsquo;s back, he realized at a glance what had happened.
      Catching her in his arms, he dragged her down on to the road and, kneeling
      over her, commenced to sob and sob like an animal, not using any words, in
      a low moaning monotone.
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one windows in the village-street were thrown open; frowsy heads
      stuck out; lights began to grope across the panes; the sleeping houses
      woke and a promiscuous crowd of half-clad people gathered. Above the
      intermittent babel of questions and answers was the constant sound of the
      Creature&rsquo;s sobbing.

      Next morning the news of Lady Zion&rsquo;s death was common property. Detectives
      came down from London and a thorough effort was made to trace the
      murderer. Near the spot in the dell where she had been discovered,
      half-a-dozen snowballs lay scattered. It was supposed that a village-boy
      had come across her there, and in one of the snowballs he had thrown,
      purposely or accidentally, had buried a stone; then, seeing her fall, had
      run away in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the school various rumors went the round. The one which found most
      favor, though we all knew it to be untrue, was that Sneard had done it.
      His supposed motive was his well-known annoyance at Lady Zion&rsquo;s irritating
      obsession that he had once loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of this excitement, while the London detectives were still
      hunting, I received a telegram from my father, unexplained and peremptory,
      &ldquo;<i>Return immediately. Bring all belongings.</i>&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX&mdash;THE DECEITFULNESS OF RICHES
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of course the telegram was connected in some way with the payment of the
      first half-yearly dividend. Perhaps my father had decided on an instant
      removal to Italy. So my schoolmates thought as they stood enviously
      watching me pack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards evening I stepped into the village&rsquo;s one and only cab. I shook the
      dust of the Red House from my feet without regret. With the intense
      selfishness of youth, my own hope for the future made me almost forgetful
      of the Creature&rsquo;s tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about eight o&rsquo;clock when I reached Pope Lane. All the front of the
      house was in darkness. I tugged vigorously at the bell, feeling a little
      slighted that none of them had been on the look-out. Directly the door
      opened, I rushed in with a mouthful of excited questions. Hetty stared at
      me disapprovingly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make so much noise, Master Dante,&rdquo; she said;
      &ldquo;your mother and Miss Ruthita &rsquo;ave &rsquo;ad a worryin&rsquo; day and &rsquo;ave
      gorn to bed. They didn&rsquo;t know you was comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I noticed that the stairway was unlighted, that the gas in the hall was on
      the jet, and that Hetty herself was partly prepared for bed. I was
      beginning to explain to her about the telegram, speaking below my breath
      the way one does when death is in the house. Just then my father came out
      from his study. His pen was behind his ear and his shoulders looked
      stoopy. His face had the worn expression of the old days, which came from
      overwork.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, why did you send for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led me into the study, closing the door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to be brave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At his words my heart sank. My eyes retreated from his face. I wanted to
      lengthen out the minutes until I should know the worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy, your Uncle Obad&rsquo;s gone to smash. We&rsquo;ve lost everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seated himself at the table, his head supported on his hand. He had
      tried to speak in a matter-of-fact manner, as much as to say, &ldquo;Of course
      this is just what we all expected.&rdquo; But I could see that hope had gone out
      of him. I wanted to say something decent and comforting; but everything
      that came to me seemed too grandiloquent. There was nothing adequate that
      could be said. Florence, realization of dreams, respite from drudgery&mdash;all
      the happiness that money alone could purchase and that had seemed so
      accessible, was now placed apparently forever beyond reach of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his pen from behind his ear and commenced aimlessly stabbing the
      blotting-pad.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke again, looking away from me. &ldquo;That money was yours. I saved it
      for you. It was for giving you a chance in the world. I ought to have
      known that your uncle wasn&rsquo;t to be trusted&mdash;he&rsquo;s never been able to
      earn a living by honest work. But there, I don&rsquo;t blame him as much as I
      blame myself. I must have been mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t we get anything back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;This fellow Rapson is a common swindler, from what I
      can make out. He simply used your uncle. He may never have had any diamond
      mines. If he had, they were worthless. He doesn&rsquo;t appear to have had any
      capital except what he got by your uncle selling his shares. He paid his
      one dividend last summer in order to tempt investors, and now he&rsquo;s
      decamped. We shan&rsquo;t see a penny back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I tried to tell him that he needn&rsquo;t worry for my sake&mdash;I could work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s why I sent for you. Of course your fees are
      all paid for this term; but if you&rsquo;ve got to enter the commercial world,
      the sooner the better. You&rsquo;ve come to an age when every day spent at
      school is a day wasted, unless you&rsquo;re going to enter a profession. You
      can&rsquo;t get a University education without money and, in any case, it&rsquo;s
      worse than valueless unless you have the money to back it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t mind working,&rdquo; I assured him; &ldquo;I shall be glad to work.
      P&rsquo;raps by starting early I&rsquo;ll be able to earn a lot of money and help you
      one day, Dad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He frowned at my cheerfulness; he had finished with optimism forever. &ldquo;You
      don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re saying. Money isn&rsquo;t so easily earned. It took me
      fifteen years of pinching and scraping to save two thousand pounds.&rdquo; Then,
      conscious of ungraciousness, he added, &ldquo;But I like your spirit, Dante, and
      it was good of you to say that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His fear of heroics and sentiment made him rise quickly and turn out the
      lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Best go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I groped my way upstairs through the darkened house. There was something
      unnatural about its darkness. Its silence was not the silence of a house
      in which people were sleeping, but one in which they lay without rest
      staring into the shadows. In my bedroom I felt it indecent to light the
      gas. I sat by the window, looking out across gardens to our neighbors&rsquo;
      illumined windows. Someone was playing a piano; it seemed disgustingly bad
      taste on their part to do that when we had lost two thousand pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      My thought veered round. What after all were two thousand pounds to be so
      miserable about! I began to feel annoyed with my father that he should
      have made such a fuss about it. I was sure that neither the Snow Lady nor
      Ruthita had wanted to go to bed so early. Probably he didn&rsquo;t really want
      to himself. He just got the idea into his head, and had forced it on the
      family. In our house, until Mr. Rapson came along, it had always been like
      that: he punished us, instead of the people who had hurt him, by the moods
      that resulted from his disappointments. Why, if it was simply a matter of
      my going to work, I rather liked the prospect. Anyhow, it was for the most
      part my concern. And then I remembered how sad he had looked, and was
      sorry that such thoughts had come into my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tap at my door made me jump up conscience-stricken. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only Ruthita,&rdquo;
       a low voice said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She crept in noiselessly as a shadow. Her warm arms went about my neck,
      drawing my face down to hers. &ldquo;Oh, Dannie, I&rsquo;m so, so sorry,&rdquo; she
      whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve never missed welcoming you home ever since you went to
      school, and you needed me most of all this evening&mdash;and because
      you&rsquo;ve got to go to work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter, Ruthie. If I go to work I&rsquo;ll earn money, and then
      I&rsquo;ll be able to do things for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me! Oh, you darling!&rdquo; Then she thought a minute and her face clouded.
      &ldquo;But no, if you go to work you&rsquo;ll marry. That&rsquo;s what always happens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood gazing up at me, her face looking frailer and purer than ever in
      the darkness. She had slipped on a long blue dressing-gown to come and see
      me, and her long black hair hung loose about her. Just below the edge of
      her gown her small pale feet showed out. Then I realized for the first
      time that she had changed as I had changed; we were no longer children.
      Perhaps the same wistful imaginings, exquisite and alluring, had come to
      her. For her also the walls of childhood, which had shut out the far
      horizon, were crumbling. Then, with an overwhelming reverence, I became
      aware of the strange fascination of her appealing beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      She snuggled herself beside me in the window. We spoke beneath our breath
      in the hushed voices of conspirators, lest we should be heard by my
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t sleep,&rdquo; she said apologetically. &ldquo;I was lonely, so I came to
      you. Everything and everybody seem so sad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was your thoughts that were sad, Ruthie. What were you thinking
      about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rubbed her cheek against mine shyly and I felt her tremble. &ldquo;I was
      thinking about you. We&rsquo;re growing up, Dante. You may go away and forget&mdash;forget
      all about me and the Snow Lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I denied stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      To which she replied, &ldquo;But people do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forget. And then I&rsquo;m not your sister really&mdash;only by pretense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you say that when boys earn money they marry. I
      don&rsquo;t think I ever shall because&mdash;well, because of something that has
      happened. So why shouldn&rsquo;t you and I agree to live always together, the
      same as we do now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said that that would be grand; she would be a little mother to me. But
      she wanted to know what made me so sure that I would always be a bachelor.
      With the sincere absurdity of youth, the more absurd because of its
      sincerity, I confided my passion for Fiesole. &ldquo;After what she has done,&rdquo; I
      said, &ldquo;I could never marry her; and yet I love her too well ever to marry
      anybody else. I can only love golden hair now, and the golden hair of
      another girl would always remind me of Fiesole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruthita was silent. Then I remembered that her hair was black and saw that
      I had been clumsy in my sentiment, so I added, &ldquo;But, Ruthie, in a sister I
      think black hair is the prettiest color in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After she had tiptoed away to her room and I had crept into bed, I lay
      awake thinking over her words&mdash;that she was only my sister by
      pretense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day my father called me to him. &ldquo;You had fifty pounds given you last
      Christmas. I want you to let me have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I supposed that he wanted me to lend it to him, so I gave him my book and
      we went together to the savings bank and drew it out. I noticed that he
      drew out Ruthita&rsquo;s fifty pounds as well. We climbed on to the top of an
      omnibus; nothing was said about where we were going.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had bought a paper and I read it across his arm as we journeyed. As he
      turned over from the first page my eye caught a column headed
      DISAPPEARANCE OF GEORGE RAPSON. Underneath was a complete account of the
      whole affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      My uncle had been interviewed by a reporter and had given a generously
      indiscreet history of the catastrophe from beginning to end. He tried to
      defend Rapson, and by his own innocent disclosures pilloried himself as a
      sanguine, gullible old ass. He insisted on believing in Rapson&rsquo;s
      integrity. Things looked queer of course, but sooner or later there would
      be an explanation, satisfactory to everybody. What the nature of that
      explanation was likely to be he could not tell, but he hoped for the best.
      He was reported as having said that Mr. Rapson had repeatedly referred to
      secret enemies in the financial world. This was the reason he had given to
      Mr. Spreckles for not disposing of his shares through the ordinary
      channels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Spreckles stated in his interview that, on the evening of the third of
      January, Rapson had called at his house. He seemed excited and said that
      certain plots were culminating against his interests which made an instant
      and secret visit to South Africa essential. He had not hinted at anything
      definitely serious, but, on the contrary, had given orders for the
      declaration of the half-yearly dividend, payment of which would not fall
      due till February. That evening he had disappeared; since then nothing had
      been heard of him. When four weeks later Mr. Spreckles drew checks on
      Rapson&rsquo;s bank-account for payment of the dividends, they were all returned
      to him dishonored. A month previously, on the morning of January the
      third, Rapson had withdrawn every penny.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the names of the people who had lost money in the adventure were
      appended. For the most part they were wealthy widows and spinsters, heavy
      contributors to various philanthropies, just the kind of people who would
      lack the business judgment which would have prevented them from entering
      into such a gamble. My father&rsquo;s name was the exception, and was given
      special attention, being headed <i>A Hard Case</i>. &ldquo;Mr. Cardover, having
      endured in his early life the humiliations and struggles which not
      infrequently fall to the lot of an ambitious penniless young man, had
      determined that his son, Dante, should not suffer a like embittering
      experience. To this end he had saved two thousand pounds to start his son
      on a professional career. This boy was Mr. Spreckles&rsquo; favorite nephew. Mr.
      Spreckles quotes the fact that it was he who induced Mr. Cardover to
      invest this money in <i>The Ethiopian Diamond Mines</i> as proof of his
      own honest belief in the value of the shares. The boy will probably now
      have to be withdrawn from the Red House, where he is being educated. Was
      it likely, Mr. Spreckles asked, that he would have been a party to the
      ruin of those whom he loved best, if he had for a moment suspected that
      the investment was not all that it was represented?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had proceeded so far with my reading, when my father crushed the paper
      viciously into a ball and tossed it over the side of the bus. For the
      first time within my remembrance I heard him swear. He was so overcome
      with irritation that he had to alight and walk it off. He kept throwing
      out jerky odds and ends of exclamations, speaking partly to me, partly to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bungling ass!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did he need to drag our names into it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A regular windbag!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First picks my pocket, then advertises my poverty. Thinks that he can
      prove himself honest by doing that!&rdquo; I put in a feeble word for my uncle,
      hinting that he didn&rsquo;t mean any harm and that it was easy to be wise after
      the event.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst of people like your Uncle Spreckles,&rdquo; my father retorted
      hotly; &ldquo;they never do mean any harm, and yet they&rsquo;re always getting into
      interminable messes.&rdquo; The storm worked itself out; we climbed on to
      another bus. At the end of an hour the streets became familiar, and I knew
      that we were nearing Chelsea.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got down within a stone&rsquo;s throw of my uncle&rsquo;s house. There it stood
      overlooking the river, shut in with its wrought-iron palings, red and
      comfortable, and outwardly prosperous as when we had parted on its steps,
      promising to come again next Christmas if we weren&rsquo;t in Florence. But when
      we attempted to enter, we had proof that its outward appearance was a
      sham. The glory had departed, and with it had gone the white-capped
      servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened to us on the chain. A slatternly kitchen-maid peered
      out through the crack. She commenced to address us at once in a voice of
      high-pitched, impudent defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wot yer want? Mr. Spreckles ain&rsquo;t &rsquo;ere, I tell yer. Yer the
      fortieth party this mornin&rsquo; that&rsquo;s come nosin&rsquo; rawnd. D&rsquo;ye think I&rsquo;ve got
      nothin&rsquo; ter do &rsquo;cept run up and darn stairs h&rsquo;answering bells? It&rsquo;s
      a shime the waie yer all piles inter one man. I calls it disgustin&rsquo;. A
      better master a girl never &rsquo;ad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I loved her for those words. They were the first that I had heard spoken
      in my uncle&rsquo;s defense. She was uttering all the pent up anger and sense of
      injustice that I had been too cowardly to express. Even on my father her
      fierce working-class loyalty to the under-dog had its effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good girl,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t talk to me like that. I&rsquo;m Mr.
      Cardover, who was staying here last Christmas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her manner changed audibly, literally audibly, at his tone of implied
      sympathy. She boo-hooed unrestrainedly as she slipped back the chain,
      permitting us to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begs yer pardon, Mr. Cardover,&rdquo; she sniveled, dusting her eyes with her
      dirty apron. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m kind o&rsquo; unnerved. My poor dear master&rsquo;s got so many
      h&rsquo;enemies nar; I didn&rsquo;t rekernize yer as &rsquo;is friend. Yer see, the
      moment this &rsquo;ere &rsquo;appened all the other servants left like a
      pack o&rsquo; rats. They didn&rsquo;t love &rsquo;im the waie I did; I come along wiv
      &rsquo;im from the boardin&rsquo; &rsquo;arse. This mornin&rsquo; &rsquo;e gives me
      notice, &rsquo;e did. &lsquo;Car&rsquo;line, I carn&rsquo;t pay yer no more wyges,&rsquo; &rsquo;e
      says. &lsquo;Gawd bless yer,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;an&rsquo; if yer carn&rsquo;t, wot does that matter?
      I ain&rsquo;t one of yer &rsquo;igh and mighty, lawdy-dah hussies that I should
      desert yer.&rsquo; Oh, Mr. Cardover, it&rsquo;s a shime the loife they&rsquo;re leadin&rsquo; the
      poor man. But there, if they sends &rsquo;im to prison, I&rsquo;ll never agen
      put me nose h&rsquo;insoide a church nor say no prayers. I&rsquo;ll just believe there
      ain&rsquo;t no Gawd in the world. The landlord, &rsquo;e&rsquo;s in there h&rsquo;at
      present wiv&rsquo;im, a-naggin&rsquo; at &rsquo;im. I was listenin&rsquo; at the key&rsquo;ole
      when yer rang the bell. But there, I&rsquo;m keepin&rsquo; yer witin&rsquo;! Won&rsquo;t yer step
      into the drarin&rsquo; room till &rsquo;e&rsquo;s by &rsquo;imself? H&rsquo;excuse me
      dirty &rsquo;ands. I &rsquo;as to do h&rsquo;everythin&rsquo; for &rsquo;im&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      only me and the master; even the Missis &rsquo;as left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she was closing the door behind her, my father called after her, &ldquo;Mrs.
      Spreckles left! That&rsquo;s astounding. Why has she done that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tousled hair and red eyes re-appeared for a second. &ldquo;Gorn back to
      start up the bo-ordin&rsquo; &rsquo;arse,&rdquo; she stammered with a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      How different the room looked from when we were last in it! The cushions
      on the sofa were awry. The windows winked at you wickedly, one blind
      lowered and the other up. It had the bewildered, disheveled swaggerness of
      a last night&rsquo;s reveler betrayed by the sunrise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Caroline had spoken my mind out for me, I felt awkward alone with my
      father. I was afraid of what he might say presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      I picked up a small, handsomely bound volume from the table while we were
      waiting. I began turning the pages, and found that it was a collected
      edition of tracts, written by my uncle and ostensibly addressed to young
      men. They had been a kind of stealthy advertisement of The Christian
      Boarding-House, calculated to make maiden aunts, into whose hands they
      fell, sit up and feel immediately that the author was the very person for
      influencing the morals of their giddy nephews. Through the persuasive
      saintliness expressed in these tracts Uncle Obad had procured many of his
      paying-guests. My eye was arrested by the title of one of them, THE
      DECEITFULNESS OF RICHES. I read, &ldquo;One of our greatest poets has written of
      finding love in huts where poor men lie. Oh, that young men might be
      brought to ponder the truth contained in those words! What is more
      difficult to obtain than love in the whole world? Can riches buy love?
      Nay, but on the contrary love and wealth are rarely found together. Many a
      powerful financier and belted earl would give all that he has in exchange
      for love. Young men, when you come to die, which of all your possessions
      can you carry with you to an after-world? Then, at least, you will learn
      the deceitfulness of riches. You thought you had everything; too late you
      know that you had nothing. Even in this life some men live to learn that
      gold is but a phantom&mdash;a vampire phantom destroying friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had got so far when footsteps and voices, loud in contention, sounded in
      the hall. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to be out of here in a fortnight, d&rsquo;yer understand?
      You&rsquo;re letting down my property the longer you stay here. You&rsquo;re giving my
      house a bad name. The address is in all the papers; people are already
      pointing it out. I won&rsquo;t stand it. That&rsquo;s my last word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The front door slammed. I heard the chain being put up. The handle of the
      drawing-room door turned hesitatingly and my uncle entered. He still wore
      the clothes of affluence, and yet the impression he made was one of
      shabbiness. He seemed to have shrunk. His jolly John Bull confidence had
      vanished and had been replaced by the hurried, appeasing manner of a
      solicitor of charity. He avoided our eyes and commenced talking at once,
      presumably to prevent my father from talking. He did not offer to shake
      hands. &ldquo;Well, Cardover, this is good of you. I hardly expected it. And, &rsquo;pon
      my word, there&rsquo;s Dante. I&rsquo;ve been having a worried time of it. I&rsquo;m a badly
      misunderstood man. But there, adversity has one advantage: it teaches us
      who <i>are</i> our friends. When the little storm has blown over I shall
      know who to drop from my acquaintance. This sudden departure of Rapson has
      had a very unfortunate effect&mdash;most unfortunate. I expect a letter
      from him by every mail; then I&rsquo;ll be able to explain matters. A good
      fellow, Rapson. A capital fellow. As straight as they make &rsquo;em. One
      of the best. Still, I wish he&rsquo;d told me more of his movements; for the
      moment affairs are a trifle awkward, I must confess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He mopped his forehead with his handkerchief and sank down on the sofa
      with the air of one who, being among pleasant companions, brushes aside
      unpleasant topics. &ldquo;Well, how&rsquo;s Dante?&rdquo; he asked, turning to me, &ldquo;and
      how&rsquo;s the Red House?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t know how to answer. The question seemed so inappropriate and
      irrelevant. All the kindness which lay between us made such conversation a
      cruel farce. I wanted to tell him how sorry I was, and yet I daren&rsquo;t in my
      father&rsquo;s presence. I realized that such cheeriness on my uncle&rsquo;s part was
      an insult, and yet I understood its motive.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father&rsquo;s face had hardened. He had expected some apology, some sign of
      humility, or at least some direct appeal to his sympathy. If any of these
      things had happened after what Caroline had said, I believe he would have
      responded. But this insincere praise of the archculprit and ostrich-like
      refusal to face facts simply angered him. He rose to his feet with the
      restrained impatience of a just man; the drawn sternness of his mouth was
      terrible. His voice had a steely coldness that pierced through all
      pretenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop this nonsense, Obad,&rdquo; he said sharply. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you realize that
      you&rsquo;ve ruined me? Won&rsquo;t you ever play the man? You know very well that
      Rapson will never come back, unless the police bring him. You&rsquo;ve been the
      tool of a conspiracy to swindle the public; it was your religious standing
      that made the swindle possible. No one&rsquo;s called you a thief as yet, but
      that&rsquo;s what everyone&rsquo;s thinking. I know you&rsquo;re not a thief, but you&rsquo;ve
      been guilty of the grossest negligence. Can&rsquo;t you bring home to yourself
      the disgrace of that? You&rsquo;ve always been a shirker of responsibility. For
      years you&rsquo;ve let your wife do all the work. And now, when through your
      silly optimism you&rsquo;ve brought dishonor on the family, you still persist in
      hiding behind shams. I tell you, Obad, you&rsquo;re a coward; you&rsquo;re trying to
      evade the moral consequences of your actions. If you can&rsquo;t feel shame now,
      you must be utterly worthless. Your attitude is an offense against every
      right-thinking man. I didn&rsquo;t set out this morning with the intention of
      speaking to you like this. But your present conduct and that idiotic
      interview in the newspapers have made me alter my mind about you. To many
      men they would prove you nearly as big a rascal as Rapson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My uncle had sat with his body crouched forward, his knees apart, his
      hands knitted together, and his eyes fixed on the carpet while my father
      had been talking. Now that there was silence he did not stir. I watched
      the bald spot on his head, how the yellow skin crinkled and went tight
      again as he bunched up and relaxed his brows. He looked so kindly and yet
      so ineffectual. My father had flayed him naked with his words. He had
      accused him of not being a man; but that was why I loved him. It was his
      unworldliness that had made it possible for him to penetrate so far into a
      child&rsquo;s world. Caroline snuffled on the other side of the keyhole.
    </p>
    <p>
      My uncle pulled apart his hands and raised his head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve said some
      harsh things, Cardover. You&rsquo;ve reminded me about Lavinia; I didn&rsquo;t need to
      be told that. I may be a fool, but I&rsquo;m not a scoundrel. I can only say
      that I&rsquo;m sorry for what&rsquo;s happened. I was well-meaning; I did it for the
      best. Is there anything else you want to tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s just this.&rdquo; My father handed him an envelope. &ldquo;It may help you to
      do the right thing in paying the investors a little of what&rsquo;s left. Of
      course you&rsquo;ll have to sell off everything and pay them as much as you can.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is this you&rsquo;ve given me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hundred pounds you gave to Dante and Ruthita at Christmas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He flushed crimson; then the blood drained away from his hands and face,
      leaving them ashy gray. His lip trembled, so that I feared terribly he was
      going to cry with the bitterness of his humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but it was a gift to them. I didn&rsquo;t expect this. Won&rsquo;t you let
      them keep it? I should like them to keep it. It&rsquo;ll make so little
      difference to the whole amount.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Obad, when will you appreciate the fact that everything you have
      given away or have, is the result of another man&rsquo;s theft?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My uncle glanced round the room furtively, taking in the meaning of those
      words. It had been my father&rsquo;s purpose to make him ashamed; that was amply
      accomplished now. He huddled back into the sofa, a broken man. He had been
      stabbed through his affections into a knowledge of reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father beckoned to me and turned. I stretched out my hand and touched
      my uncle. He took no notice. The sunlight streamed in on the creased bald
      head, the dust, and the forfeited splendor. Reluctantly I tiptoed out and
      was met in the hall by the hot indignant eyes of Caroline, accusing me of
      treachery across the banisters.

      CHAPTER X&mdash;THE LAST OF THE RED HOUSE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n after years it
      became a habit with my father to say grimly that Uncle Obad&rsquo;s Christmas
      dinner was the most expensive he had ever eaten&mdash;it had cost him two
      thousand pounds. This was the only reference to the unfortunate past that
      he permitted himself. On calm reflection I think he was a little sorry for
      the caustic frankness of some of his remarks; he was willing to forget
      them. Besides, as it happened, one of my uncle&rsquo;s least forgivable offenses&mdash;the
      mentioning of our names to the newspaper men&mdash;resulted in an
      extraordinary stroke of luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week after our visit to Chelsea, my father received a letter. It was
      from a firm of lawyers and stated that a friend, who had read of our loss,
      was anxious to provide the money for my education; the only condition made
      was that he should be allowed to remain anonymous.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first my father flatly refused to put himself under such an obligation
      to an unknown person. &ldquo;One would think that we were paupers,&rdquo; he said;
      &ldquo;such an offer may be kindly meant, but it&rsquo;s insulting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was so sensitive on the subject that we none of us dared to argue the
      matter. We considered the affair as closed, and began to consider what
      walk of business I should enter. Then we discovered that my father had
      gone off on the quiet and interviewed the lawyers; as a consequence, a
      second and more pressing letter arrived, stating that the anonymous
      benefactor would be gravely disappointed if we did not accept. He was
      childless and had often wished to do something for me. My father&rsquo;s
      misfortune was his opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our curiosity was piqued. Who of our friends or acquaintance was
      childless? We ran over the names of all possible benefactors&mdash;a task
      not difficult, for we had few friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of my mother&rsquo;s father, Sir Charles Evrard, was suggested. He
      fitted the description exactly; the long estrangement which had resulted
      from my father&rsquo;s elopement supplied the motive for his desire to suppress
      his personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of this guess Ruthita wove for me a romantic future, opening to my
      astonished imagination a career more congenial than any I had dreamt in my
      boldest moments. Up to this time, save for whispered hints from my
      grandmother Cardover, no mention had been made of my mother&rsquo;s family. My
      father&rsquo;s plebeian pride had never recovered from the shock and humiliation
      of his early years. At first out of jealous purpose, latterly from force
      of habit and the delicacy which men feel after re-marriage, he had allowed
      me to grow up in almost entire ignorance of my maternal traditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that the subject had to be discussed he became obstinately silent to
      the point of sullenness. The Snow Lady came to the rescue. &ldquo;Leave him to
      me,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I know how to manage him, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laid it tactfully before him that he had no right to let his personal
      likes or dislikes prevent me from climbing back into my mother&rsquo;s rank in
      society. I was my grandfather&rsquo;s nearest kin and, if our surmise proved
      correct, this might be Sir Charles&rsquo;s first step towards a reconciliation&mdash;a
      step which might end in his making his will in my favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandmother Cardover was communicated with and instructed to report on the
      lie of the country. She replied that folks said that old Sir Charles was
      wonderfully softened. She also informed us that Lord Halloway, the next of
      kin to myself, had been up to some more of his devilry and was in disgrace
      with his uncle. This time it was to do with a Ransby bathing-machine man&rsquo;s
      daughter. Lord Halloway was my second-cousin, the Earl of Lovegrove&rsquo;s; son
      and heir. His Christian name was Denville; I came to know him less
      formally in later days as Denny Halloway.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was packed off to my grandmother, ostensibly for a week&rsquo;s holiday at
      Ransby&mdash;in reality to put our hazard to the test.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransby to-day is a little sleepy seaside town. The trade has gone away
      from it. Every summer thousands of holiday-makers from London invade it
      with foreign, feverish gaiety; when they are gone it relapses into its
      contented old-world quiet. In my boyhood, however, it was a place of
      provincial bustle and importance. The sailing vessels from the Baltic
      crowded its harbor, lying shoulder to shoulder against its quays,
      unloading their cargoes of tallow and timber and hemp. Now all that
      remains is the herring fishery and the manufacture of nets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandmother Cardover&rsquo;s house stood near the harbor; from the street we
      could see the bare masts of the shipping lying at rest. In the front on
      the ground-floor was the shop, piled high with the necessaries of
      sea-going travel. There were coils of rope in the doorway, and anchors and
      sacks of ship&rsquo;s biscuits; a little further in tarpaulin and oil-skin
      jackets hung from the ceiling, interspersed with smoked hams; and, at the
      back, stood rows of cheeses and upturned barrels on which ear-ringed
      sailor-men would sit and chat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the counter was a door, with windows draped with red curtains. It
      led into what was called the keeping-room, a cozy parlor in which we took
      our meals, while through the window in the door we could watch the
      customers enter. The keeping-room had its own peculiar smell, comfortable
      and homelike. I scarcely know how to describe it; it was a mixture of
      ozone, coffee, and baking bread. Out of the keeping-room lay the kitchen,
      with its floor of red bricks and its burnished pots and pans hung in rows
      along the walls. It was my grandmother&rsquo;s boast that the floor was so
      speckless that you could eat a meal off it. Across the courtyard at the
      back lay the bakehouse, with its great hollow ovens and troughs in which
      men with naked feet trod out the dough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandmother had never been out of Ransby save to visit us at Pope Lane,
      and this rarely. Even then, after a fortnight she was glad to get back.
      She said that Ransby was better than London; you weren&rsquo;t crowded and knew
      everyone you met. The streets of London were filled with stranger-windows
      and stranger-faces, whereas in Ransby every house was familiar and had its
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      She carried, strung from a belt about her waist, all the keys of her bins
      and cupboards. You knew when she was coming by the way they jangled. She
      was a widow, and perfectly happy. On Sundays she attended the Methodist
      Chapel in the High Street, with its grave black pulpit and high-backed
      pews. On week-days she marshaled her sea-captains, handsome bearded men,
      and entertained them at her table, In spite of younger rivals, who tried
      to win their patronage from her by cuts in prices, she held their custom
      by her honest personality. I believe many of them made her offers of
      marriage, for she was still comely to look at; she refused them as lovers
      and kept them as friends. She usually dressed in black, with a gold locket
      containing the hair of her husband, many years dead, hung about her neck.
      Her hair was arranged in two rows of corkscrew curls, which reached down
      to her shoulders from under a prim white cap. She had a trick of making
      them waggle when she wished to be emphatic. She was a good deal of a
      gossip, was by instinct an antiquary, and had a lively sense of wit which
      was kept in check by a genuine piety&mdash;in short, she was a thoroughly
      wholesome, capable, loving woman. The type to which she belonged is now
      quickly vanishing&mdash;that of the more than middle-aged person who knows
      how to grow old usefully and graciously: a woman of the lower-middle class
      not chagrined by her station, who acknowledged cheerfully that she had her
      superiors and, demanding respect from others, gave respect ungrudgingly
      where it was due. She was a shop-keeper proud of her shop-keeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      That week at Ransby was a kind of tiptoe glory. My Grannie took me very
      seriously; she had under her roof a boy who would surely be a baronet,
      perhaps a lord, and maybe an earl. What had only been an expectation with
      us was for her a certainty. The floodgate of her reminiscence was opened
      wide; she swept me far out into the romantic past with her accounts of my
      mother&rsquo;s ancestry. The Evrards were no upstart nobility; they had their
      roots in history. She could tell me how they returned from exile with King
      Charles, or how they sailed out with Raleigh to destroy the Armada. But I
      liked to hear best about my mother, how she rode into Ransby under her
      scarlet plumes, on her great gray horse, with her flower face; and how my
      father caught sight of her and loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to understand my father in a new way, entirely sympathetic. He was
      a man who had tasted the best of life at the first. There was something
      epic about his sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      These conversations usually took place in the keeping-room at night. The
      shutters of the shop had been put up. The gas was unlighted. The flames of
      the fire, dancing in the grate, split the darkness into shadows which
      groped across the walls. Everything was hushed and cozy. My Grannie,
      seated opposite to me, on the other side of the fireplace, would bend
      forward in her chair as she talked; when she came to exciting passages her
      little gray curls would bob, or to passages of sentiment she would remove
      her shiny spectacles to wipe her eyes. If she stopped at a loss for the
      next topic, all I had to say was, &ldquo;And how did Sir Charles Evrard look,
      Grannie, when he came to you that first morning after they had run away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looked, as he has always looked, my dear, an aristocrate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did he treat you? Wasn&rsquo;t he angry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angry with a woman! Certainly not. He treated me like a courtly gentleman&mdash;with
      respect. He dismounts and comes into my shop as leisurely as though he had
      only stepped in to exchange the greetings of the day. He raises his hat to
      me as he enters. &lsquo;A fine day, Mrs. Cardover,&rsquo; he says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A fine day, Sir Charles, but inclined to blow up squally,&rsquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he turns his face away and inquires, &lsquo;If it&rsquo;s not troubling you, can
      I see your son this morning?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He went to London early,&rsquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He puts his hand to his throat quickly, as if he were choking. Then he
      asks huskily, still not looking at me, &lsquo;Did he go alone?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That, Sir Charles, is more than I can say.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Quite right. Quite right.&rsquo; And he speaks so quickly that he startles me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he turns round, trying to smile, and shows me a face all old and
      pale. &lsquo;A very fine day for someone; but it&rsquo;s true what you say, it&rsquo;ll blow
      up squally later.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And with that he leaves me, raising his hat, and rides away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you knew all the time?&rdquo; I ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We both knew all the time,&rdquo; she replies.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the daytime we went through the flat wind-swept country on
      excursions to Woadley Hall. Our hope was that we might meet Sir Charles,
      and that he would recognize me. Unfortunately, on the afternoon of my
      arrival he had a hunting accident, and kept the house during all the
      period of my stay. My nearest approach to seeing him was one evening, when
      the winter dusk had gathered early; I hid in the shrubbery outside the
      library and saw his shadow fall across the blind. He seemed to stand near
      the window listening. We were not more than two yards separated. I wonder,
      did some instinct, subtler than the five senses, let him know of the
      starved yearning that was calling to him out there in the dark? How those
      long watches in Woadley Park stirred up memories, and made my mother live
      again!
    </p>
    <p>
      When the week had expired, I returned to Pope Lane. The offer was
      re-debated and at last accepted. I went back to the Red House and there
      learnt the fickleness of popularity. My uncle&rsquo;s downfall had caused me to
      become a far less exalted person. My influence was gone; a period of
      persecution threatened. The Bantam alone stood by me; even in his eyes I
      was a Samson shorn of his glory. The renewed, half-shy interest taken in
      me by the Creature was a doubtful asset. Our friendship was a coalition of
      two weaknesses, and resulted in nothing profitable in the way of social
      strength. He did his best to make things up to me. He was almost womanly
      in his kindness. Now that Lady Zion was gone he felt a great emptiness in
      life; he borrowed me that, in some measure, I might fill her place. He
      told Sneard that he wished to coach me that I might sit for a scholarship
      at Oxford. Permission was granted, so we both got off prep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evening after evening I would spend at his cottage, the lamp lighted and
      the books spread out on the table. He decided that I was not much good at
      natural science, and declared that I must specialize in history. He was a
      genius in his way, and had amazing stores of information. When he overcame
      his hesitating shyness, he showed himself a scholar of erudite knowledge
      and intrepid imagination. He had a passion for antiquity that amounted to
      idolatry, and a faculty which was almost uncanny for making the dead world
      live again. While he spoke I would forget his shabbiness, his
      chalk-stained hands, uncouth gestures, and revolting untidiness. He was a
      magician who unlocked the doors of the storied past; he owned the
      right-of-way through all men&rsquo;s minds, from Homer to Herbert Spencer. When
      he spoke of soldiers, his air was bullying and defiant. But it was when he
      spoke of women that he spoke with his heart. Then, all unaware of what he
      was doing, he pulled aside the curtains and let me gaze in upon the empty
      rooms of his life. It was he who pointed out to me that, with rare
      exceptions, it is not the virtuous but only the beautiful women that the
      world remembers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was odd to think what images of loveliness went to and fro behind that
      soiled mask of outward personality, in the hidden temples of his brain.
      The Creature was a man you had to love or dislike, to know altogether or
      not to know at all. In that last year and a half at the Red House, when he
      tapped me on the shoulder and led me away by the revelation of his curious
      secret charm, I got both to know and to love him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet there was always fear in my friendship. He was queer like his
      sister before him. Her death seemed to have unbalanced his reason; it was
      a weakness that grew upon him. He seemed to have lost his power of
      distinguishing between the present and the imaginary or the past. Often in
      the cottage he would forget that his sister was not still alive and,
      rising from the table, would look beyond me as if he saw her, or would go
      out into the passage and call to her. Nothing in the cottage had been
      changed since her departure. Her belongings lay untouched, just where she
      had left them, as though her return was hourly expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell into the way of imitating her gestures, and humming snatches of
      her crazy songs. He would tumble over the precipice into the abyss of
      insanity without warning, in the middle of being rational; and would
      clamber back just as suddenly, apparently without knowledge of where he
      had gone. Of one of her songs he was extremely fond. I had often heard
      Lady Zion sing it as she rode between the hedges, and had been made aware
      of her approach long before I caught sight of her:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;All the chimneys in our town
    </p>

     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Some safe-guarding astuteness prevented him from showing his weakness at
      the Red House; and I was too fond of him to tell. To the rest of the boys
      he was only the grubby, somewhat eccentric little &ldquo;stinks&rdquo; master.
      Nevertheless, sane or insane, it was through the Creature&rsquo;s efforts that,
      after a year of coaching, I won a history scholarship at Lazarus for
      eighty pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, eighty pounds would not carry me to Oxford. It became a worrying
      problem to my family exactly what my grandfather, if he were my
      benefactor, had meant by &ldquo;undertaking the expenses of my education.&rdquo; His
      generosity might be co-terminous with my school-days. A month after the
      winning of the scholarship the lawyers wrote, setting our minds at rest
      and congratulating me on my success in the name of their client. This
      letter was gratifying in more than a monetary sense&mdash;it was a sign
      that the anonymous friend was keeping a close watch on my doings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the interview at Chelsea there had been no intercourse between my
      father and Uncle Obad. I had once contrived to see my uncle by stealth,
      but the first question he had asked me was, did I come with my father&rsquo;s
      knowledge. When I could not give him that assurance, he had sorrowfully
      refused to have anything to do with me. At the time I shrank from
      mentioning the matter to my father; so for a year and a half my uncle and
      his doings had dropped completely out of my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my treatment of him weighed on my conscience. My last term at school
      had ended. It was August, and in October I expected to go up to Oxford.
      With my scholarship and the money the lawyers sent me I should soon be a
      self-supporting person. Already I thought myself a man. I felt that on the
      whole my father&rsquo;s quarrel with my uncle was reasonable, but I could not
      see why I should be made to share it. So one day as I got up from
      breakfast, I mentioned casually that I was going to run over to Charity
      Grove.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just such another golden morning as the one of ten years earlier,
      when I had driven for the first time across London behind Dollie. What a
      big important person the Spuffler had seemed to me then! How wonderful
      that he, a grown-up, should take so much trouble to be friendly to a
      little chap! Then my mind wandered back over all his repeated kindness&mdash;all
      that he had stood for in the past as a harbor of refuge from the stormy
      misunderstandings of childhood. He and the Creature, both failures and
      generally despised, were two of the best men that I had ever met. Whatever
      his faults, he still was splendid.
    </p>
    <p>
      I came to the Christian Boarding House, and passed up the driveway shut in
      with heavy evergreens. Caroline, tousled of hair, all loose ends, girt
      about her middle with a sackcloth apron, was on her knees bricking the
      steps. She did not recognize me. The Mistress was out shopping, she said,
      but the Master was in the paddock. &ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;feeding the
      fowls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I passed through the decayed old rooms, with their heavy shabby furniture,
      so evidently picked up cheap at auctions; then I passed out through the
      French windows into the cool garden, where sunshine dappled the lawn,
      struggling with difficulty through the crowded branches. At the gate into
      the paddock I halted. There he was with a can of water in his hand,
      fussing, in and out his coops and hutches, so extremely busy, as though
      the future of the world depended on his efforts. I suppose he was still
      evolving that strain of perpetually laying hens, The Spreckles, which was
      to bring him fame and fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      I called to him, &ldquo;Uncle Obad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had recovered from his emotion, I soon found that the old fellow
      had long ago emerged from all personal sense of disgrace with his usual
      corklike irrepressibility. He chatted with me cheerily, calling me, &ldquo;Old
      chap,&rdquo; just as though nothing painful had happened to separate us. On
      being ousted from Chelsea, he had immediately dropped back, with something
      like a sigh of relief, into his former world of momentous trifles&mdash;philanthropy
      and fowls. &ldquo;We lived at a terrible pace, old chap. It was wearing us out.
      We couldn&rsquo;t have stood it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke as if the abdication of his brief period of affluence had been
      voluntary. I scented here one of his spuffling explanations to his
      neighbors for his precipitate return to the boarding-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      On inquiry I found that all his philanthropic societies had forgiven and
      taken him back. After sulking a while and flirting with various paid
      secretaries, they had agreed for economy&rsquo;s sake to let bygones be bygones.
      They had been unable to find any other person who would serve them as
      loyally without salary, and who at the same time was able to offer up such
      beautiful extempore prayers. The list of their contributors had afforded
      Rapson his happiest hunting-ground. Procuring my uncle&rsquo;s services for
      nothing was their only way of getting anything back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what about Rapson?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Do you still believe in him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head dolefully. &ldquo;I begin to lose faith, Dante; I begin to
      doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But have you heard from him since he went away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated and then he said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Kitty, you know. He didn&rsquo;t do the
      straight thing by her. No, I&rsquo;m afraid Rapson wasn&rsquo;t a good man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At mention of Kitty I pricked up my ears; I had often wondered about her.
      &ldquo;What had Kitty to do with him?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Were they engaged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, unfortunately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish they had been. After he&rsquo;d left her, she was awfully cut up. I did
      what I could for her. You remember that hundred pounds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father&mdash;at Chelsea&mdash;the Christmas present?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I couldn&rsquo;t keep it. I gave it to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You always have to be giving something,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were sitting on an upturned barrow in the paddock when this
      conversation took place. I thought how characteristic of Uncle Obad that
      was&mdash;to be helping others at a time when he himself was most in need
      of help. But his kindness knew no seasons. Then I began, as a very young
      man will, to think of Kitty, and, because of her frailty, to picture her
      through a haze of romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Kitty now?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s in a photographer&rsquo;s at Oxford. She serves behind a counter. But,
      come, you&rsquo;ve not told me yet what you think of my fowls.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XI&mdash;STAR-DUST DAYS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he walls of the
      garden had fallen. Childhood was ended and with it all those absurd,
      aching fears lest I should never be a man and lest time might be a
      stationary, unescapable present, with no trap-doors giving access to the
      future. The experiment of life had begun in earnest, and the adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      That first October night of my residence at Oxford is forever memorable.
      Before leaving Pope Lane I had been led aside by my father. He had taken
      it for granted that I was now capable of a man&rsquo;s follies and had warned me
      against them. Somehow his assumption that I had it in my choice to become
      a Don Juan warmed my heart; it impressed me as a tribute to my manhood&mdash;a
      tacit acknowledgment that I was a free agent. Free at last!
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not understand one-tenth part of all that he hinted at. But his
      presumption that I did understand seemed to me a form of compliment. To
      ask for an explanation was a heroism of which I was not capable. So I left
      home clad in the armor of ignorance to do battle with the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruthita wanted to accompany me to the station. I would not let her. She
      was weepy in private; I knew that in public she would be worse. I had
      inherited my father&rsquo;s dread of sentiment and his fear lest other people
      should construe it as weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Paddington I met the Bantam; we were entering the same college and
      traveled up together. We chose our places in a &ldquo;smoker&rdquo; by way of
      emphasizing to ourselves our emancipation. We tried to appear ordinary and
      at ease; beneath our mask of carelessness we felt delightfully bold and
      bad. In our carriage were three undergraduates, finished products of
      indifferent haughtiness. Though no more than a year our seniors, they
      loaded their pipes and puffed away without fear or furtiveness. They
      affected to be unaware of us. They were infinitely bored in manner and
      addressed the porters in a tone of lackadaisical, frigid tolerance. What
      masterfulness! And yet one term of Oxford would give us the right to be
      like that!&mdash;we, who so recently had been liable to be told that
      children must be seen and not heard. The assurance of these youthful men
      imperiled our courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we neared Iffley, the domes and spires of the Mecca of dreamers swam
      up. The sky was pearl-colored without a cloud. Strewn throughout its great
      emptiness was the luminous dust of stars. All the tinsel ambitions which
      had lately stirred me were forgotten as the home of lost causes claimed
      me. I grew large within myself as, in watching its advance behind the
      river above the tree-tops, I merged my personality in this vision of
      architectural romance. Leaning against the horizon, stretching up and up,
      out of the murk of dusk and the blood-red decay of foliage, it symbolized
      for me all the yearning after perfection and the passionate desire for
      freedom that had always lain hidden in my heart. I wanted to be like that&mdash;the
      thing that gray pyramided stone seen at twilight can alone express&mdash;wise,
      unimpassioned, lovely, immutable.
    </p>
    <p>
      We came to a standstill in the shabby station, which of all stations is
      probably the best beloved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank the Lord, we&rsquo;re here at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a hansom, with a sporting cabby for our driver, we rattled through the
      ancient lamp-lit town where the ghosts of the dead summer rustled and
      reddened against the walls. Past the Castle we sped, through Carfax, down
      the High, past Oriel and Christ Church till we drew up with a jerk at
      Lazarus. Whatever we had suffered in the train in the way of lowered
      opinion of self was now made up to us; the servility of the College porter
      and scouts was eloquent of respect. We were undoubtedly persons of
      importance. If we wanted further proof of it, this awaited us in the pile
      of communications from Oxford tradesmen, notified beforehand of our
      coming, humbly soliciting our patronage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bantam&rsquo;s room and mine were next door to one another in Augustine&rsquo;s
      Quad; fires were burning in the grates to bid us welcome. The scout, who
      acted as guide, seized the opportunity to sell us each a second-hand tin
      bath, a coal-scuttle, and a kettle at very much more than their first-hand
      prices. We felt no resentment. His deferential manner was worth the extra.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as we had commenced unpacking, the bell began to toll. We slipped on
      our gowns and followed the throng into a vaulted, dimly-lighted hall,
      where we dined at long tables off ancient silver, and had beer set before
      us. Surely we were men!
    </p>
    <p>
      That night the Bantam and I sat far into the small, cold hours of the
      morning; there was no one to worry us to go to bed. When the Bantam had
      left, I lay awake in a state of bewildered ecstasy. I had become aware in
      the last ten hours of my unchartered personality. I realized that my life
      was my own to command, to make or mar. As the bells above the sleeping
      city rang out time&rsquo;s progress, all the pageant of the lads of other ages,
      who had come up to Oxford star-eyed, as I had come, passed before me. When
      the withered leaves tapped against the walls, I could fancy that it was
      their footfall. They had come with a chance equal to mine; at the end of a
      few years they had departed. Some had succeeded and some had failed. Of
      all that great army which now stretched bivouacked throughout eternity,
      only the latest recruits were in sight. The scholar-monks, the
      soldier-saints, the ruffian-students of early centuries, the cavaliers,
      the philosophers, and the statesmen, together with the roisterers of the
      rank and file, were all equally and completely gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the silence of my narrow room, with the flickering fire dying in the
      hearth, there brooded over me the shadowy darkness of the ages. What
      religion does for some men, for me the gray poetry of this poignant city
      accomplished. I had become aware that from henceforth the ultimate
      responsibility for my actions must rest forever with myself. I was
      strangely unafraid of this knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were dim dawn-days that followed, when the air was filled with
      star-dust&mdash;neither with suns, nor moons, nor stars, only with the
      excitement of their promise. My world was at twilight, blurred and
      mysterious; only the huge design was clearly discernible&mdash;the cracks
      and imperfections were concealed from me, shrouded in dusk. I lived in a
      land of ideals, drawing my rules of conduct from the realism of the
      classics&mdash;a realism which even to the Greeks and Romans was only an
      aspiration, never a practice. Existence had for me all the piquant
      fascination which comes of half-knowledge&mdash;the charming allurement,
      leaving room for speculation, which the glimpse of a girl&rsquo;s face has at
      nightfall. It was an age when all things seemed possible, because all were
      untested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually, out of the wilderness of strange faces, some became more
      familiar than others; little groups of friends-began to form. The
      instinctive principle on which my set came together was enthusiastic
      rebellion against convention and eager curiosity concerning existence. One
      by one, without appointing any place of meeting, we would drift into some
      man&rsquo;s room. This usually occurred about eight in the evening, after dinner
      in hall. The lamp would be left unlighted; the couch would be drawn near
      the fire; then we would commence a conversation which was half jesting and
      half confessional.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the cloak of laughing cynicism we hid a desperate purpose. We wanted
      to know about life. We sought in each new face to discover if it could
      tell us. We had nothing to guide us but the carefully prepared disclosures
      which had been vouchsafed us in our homes. We had risen at a bound into a
      man&rsquo;s estate, and still retained a boy&rsquo;s knowledge. We realized that life
      was bigger, bolder, more adventurous, more disastrous than we had
      reckoned. Why was it that some men failed, while others had success? What
      external pressures caused the difference in achievement between Napoleon,
      for instance, and Charles Lamb? Who was responsible for our varying
      personalities? Where did our own responsibility begin, and where did it
      end?
    </p>
    <p>
      The problems we argued predated the Decalogue, yet to us they were
      eternally original and personal. We attacked them with youthful insolence.
      The authority of no social institution was safe from our irreverence. We
      accepted nothing, neither religion, nor marriage; we had to go back to the
      beginning and re-mint truth for ourselves. Our real object in coming
      together was that we might pool our scraps of actual experience, and out
      of these materials fashion our conjectures.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one topic of inexhaustible interest. It permeated all our
      inquiry&mdash;<i>woman</i>. We knew so little about her; but we knew that
      she held the key opening the door to all romance. What gay cavaliers we
      could be in discussing her, and how sheepish in the presence of one
      concrete specimen of her sex&mdash;especially if she were beautiful, and
      not a relative!
    </p>
    <p>
      All the adventures we had ever heard of seemed now within our grasp. Woman
      was the great unknown to us. We knew next to nothing of the penalties&mdash;only
      the romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little the boldest among us, recognizing that talk led nowhere,
      began to put matters to the test. The same shy restraint that had made me
      afraid of Fiesole when she had tempted me to kiss her, made me an onlooker
      now. A saving common sense prompted me to await the proof of events. I
      acted on instinct, not on principle. The difference between myself and
      some of my friends was a difference of temperament. Perhaps it was a
      difference between daring and cowardice. There are times when our
      weaknesses appear to be virtues, preserving us from shipwreck. I was
      capable of tempestuous thoughts; while they remained thoughts I could
      clothe them with idealism and glamor. But I was incapable of impassioned
      acts; their atmosphere would be beyond my control&mdash;the atmosphere of
      inevitable vulgarity which results from contemporary reality. My
      observation of unrestraint taught me that unrestraint was ugly. In short,
      I had a pagan imagination at war with a puritan conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my day, there was no right or wrong in undergraduate Oxford&mdash;no
      moral or immoral. Every conventional principle of conduct which we had
      learnt, we flung into the crucible of new experience to be melted down
      and, out of the ordeal, minted afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      We divided ourselves into two classes: those who experimented and those
      who watched. There was only one sin in our calendar&mdash;not to be a
      gentleman. To be a gentleman, in our sense of the word, was to be a
      sportsman and to have good manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our private methods of thought we were uninterfered with by those in
      authority. The University&rsquo;s methods of disciplining our actions were, and
      still are, a survival of mediævalism. If an undergraduate was seen
      speaking to a lady, he had to be able to prove her pedigree or run the
      risk of being sent down. At nine o&rsquo;clock Big Tom rang; ten minutes later
      every college-door was shut and a fine was imposed for knocking in or out.
      In the streets the proctors and their bulldogs commenced to go the rounds.
      Until twelve a man was safe in the streets, provided he appeared to be
      innocently employed and wore his cap and gown. Knocking into college after
      twelve was a grave offense.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a man observed these rules or was crafty, he might investigate life to
      his heart&rsquo;s content. Public opinion was extremely lenient. Conduct was a
      purely personal matter as long as it did not inconvenience anybody else.
      If a man had the all-atoning social grace, and was careful not to get
      caught in an incriminating act, though everybody knew about it from his
      own lips afterwards, he was not censured.
    </p>
    <p>
      My cousin, Lord Halloway, had been a Lazarus man. Oxford still treasured
      the memory of his amorous exploits.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been a good deal of a dare-devil and was regarded as something of a
      hero; he inspired us with awe, for, despite his recklessness, he had
      played the game gaily and escaped detection. The impression that this kind
      of thing created was that indiscretions were only indiscreet when they
      were bungled. Punishment seemed the penalty for discovery&mdash;not for
      the sin itself. Naturally it was the foolish and less flagrant sinners who
      got caught. For instance, there was the Bantam.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first term the Bantam watched and listened. There were occasions when
      he was a little shocked. When Christmas came round, having no home to go
      to, he kept on his rooms in college, and spent the vacation in residence.
      I returned to Pope Lane, and found that the womanliness of Ruthita and the
      Snow Lady had a sanitary effect. The wholesome sweetness of their
      affection, after the hot-house discussions of a group of boyish men, came
      like a breath of pure air. I fell back into the old trustfulness. I
      recognized that society had secret restraints and delicacies, a disclosure
      of the motives for which was not yet allowable; at the proper season life
      would explain itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When college re-assembled I noticed a change in the Bantam. He was soulful
      and sentimental&mdash;he took more pains with his dressing. He was
      continually slipping off by himself; when he returned he volunteered no
      information as to the purpose of his errand. When the eternal problem of
      woman was discussed, he smiled in a wise and melancholy manner. If he
      contributed a remark, it was not a guess, but had the air of authoritative
      finality. One night I tackled him. &ldquo;What have you been up to, Bantam? You
      know too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He twisted his pipe in his mouth pensively. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the sweetest little
      girl in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would not tell me her name. He had pledged her his word not to do that.
      There was a reason&mdash;she was working, and she belonged to too high a
      rank in society to work. She wished to remain obscure, until she could
      re-instate herself. She was a Cinderella who would one day emerge from
      poverty into splendor. The Bantam said his emotions were almost too sacred
      to talk about. Nevertheless, he meandered on with his mystery from
      midnight to three o&rsquo;clock. She was a lady and terribly persecuted. He had
      come to her rescue just at the identical moment when a good influence was
      most needed. All through the Christmas Vac he had acted the big brother&rsquo;s
      part, shielding her from temptation. She was lovely&mdash;there lay the
      pity of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pointed out that there were ten thousand ways of flirting with girls,
      and that this was the most dangerous. His white knighthood was affronted
      by that word <i>flirting</i>. He became indignant and said I was no
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      As time went on, acquaintance after acquaintance would drop in to see me,
      and would hint gravely at a deep and romantic passion which the Bantam had
      imparted to them alone. When I informed them that I also was in his
      confidence, they would repeat to me the same vague story of persecuted
      loveliness, but always with embellishments. By and by, the embellishments
      varied so irreconcilably that I began to suspect that they referred to
      more than one girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of us were in love with love in those days; we were all quite certain
      that an incandescent purifying passion lay ahead of us. It might knock at
      our door any hour&mdash;and then our particular problem would be solved.
      This hope was rarely mentioned. To one another we strove to give the
      impression of being cynical and careless. Yet always, beneath our pose of
      flippancy, we were seeking the face pre-destined to be for us the most
      beautiful in all the world. For myself, I was feverishly eager in its
      quest. I would scour the green-gray uplands of the Thames, telling myself
      that she might lie hidden in the cheerful quiet of some thatched farm.
      Every new landscape became the possible setting for my individual romance.
      I lived each day in expectancy of her coming. Sometimes at nightfall I
      would pause outside a lighted shop-window, arrested by a girl&rsquo;s profile,
      and would pretend to myself that I had found her. That was how Rossetti
      found Miss Siddall; perhaps that was how it would happen to myself. One
      thing was certain: whenever and wherever I found her, whether in the guise
      of shop-girl, dairy-maid, or lady, for me the golden age would commence. I
      stalked through life on the airy stilts of an æsthetic optimism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, but the Bantam, he was all for doing! If he could not find the love he
      wanted, he would seize the next best. Yet he would never admit that he was
      in love. He deceived himself into believing that he acted on the most
      altruistic motives. If others misunderstood him, it was because they were
      of grosser fiber. Other men, doing the things he did, laughingly
      acknowledged their rakishness; he, however, considered himself a
      self-appointed knight-errant to ladies in distress. He became involved in
      endless entanglements. It was by appealing to his higher nature with some
      pitiful story, that his transient attractions caught him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never knew a man so unfortunate in his genius for discovering lonely
      maidens in need of his protection. He always meant to be noble and
      virtuous, but his temperament was not sufficiently frigid to carry him
      safely through such ticklish adventures. He never learnt when to leave
      off; his fatal and theatric conception of chivalry continually led him on
      to situations more powerfully tempting. It would be easy to explain him by
      saying that he was a sentimental ass. But so were we all. The Bantam came
      to his ruin because he was lonely, because he had no social means of
      meeting women who were his equals, and because he was too kind-hearted;
      but mainly because he attributed to all women indiscriminately a virtue
      which unfortunately they do not all possess.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sinned accidentally and therefore carelessly&mdash;not wisely, but too
      well. A man like Lord Halloway sinned of set purpose and laid his plans
      ahead; so far as society&rsquo;s opinion of him was concerned he came off
      comparatively scatheless. The worst that was ever said of him was that he
      was a gay dog. Women even seemed to like him for it. I suppose he
      intrigued their fancy, and made them long to reform him. From this I
      learnt that the gaping sins of a gay dog are more easily forgiven than the
      peccadilloes of a sentimental donkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Easter Vacation of our first year at Oxford, the Bantam stayed at
      Putney. In the same house was an actress, very beautiful and more sorely
      used by the world than even the first girl. In the summer-time there was a
      widow at Torquay. In the beginning of our second year of residence there
      was a bar-maid at Henley. After that they followed in rapid succession.
      Wherever he went he found some woman starving for his sympathy. They were
      all ladies and phenomena of beauty, to judge from his accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came to make confession to me, it was a little difficult to follow
      which particular lady he was talking about. He never mentioned them by
      name, and seemed to try to give the impression that they were one
      composite person.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening I got him with his back to the wall. &ldquo;Bantam, who is this
      Oxford girl&mdash;the first one you got to know about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he admitted that she was a shop-girl. I knew what that meant: some of
      the Oxford tradesmen engaged girls for the prettiness of their faces, that
      they might attract custom by flirting with the undergrads. Little by
      little I narrowed him down in his general statements till I had guessed
      the shop in which she worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she a good girl?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of taking offense, he answered, &ldquo;Dante, the thought of her
      goodness often makes me ashamed of myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was evident, though he would not admit it, that this affair at least
      was serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why does she stay there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t help herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t she help herself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s an orphan and has a living to earn. She&rsquo;s afraid to get out of a
      situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what good are you doing her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helping her to keep up her courage by letting her know that one man
      respects her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think she may get to expect more than that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. Why should she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just because girls do,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Do you write her letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you write about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wouldn&rsquo;t tell me that. Next day I went down to the shop to investigate
      matters. Since the Bantam wouldn&rsquo;t listen to sense, I intended to hint to
      the girl the danger of what she was doing. Of course she could never marry
      him; but I was morally certain that that was what she was aiming at.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shop was a stationer&rsquo;s. I had chosen an hour in the afternoon when it
      was likely to be empty, everyone being engaged in some form of athletics.
      I entered and saw a daintily gowned woman with her back turned towards me.
      She was all in white. Her waist was of the smallest. She had a mass of
      honey-colored hair. She swung about at sound of my footstep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Kitty, of all people in the world! I didn&rsquo;t expect to find you
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As good as old times,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often seen you pass the window,
      but I thought you wouldn&rsquo;t want to know me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because of what happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rapson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flushed and hung her head. I wondered if she meant what I thought she
      meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hated to see her sad; she looked so young and pretty. I began to ask her
      what she was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doing! Minding shop, remembering, growing old, and earning my living.
      It&rsquo;s just horrid to be here, Dante. I have to watch you &lsquo;Varsity men
      having a good time&mdash;and once I belonged to your set. And they come in
      and stare at me, and pay me silly compliments&mdash;and I have to smile
      and pretend I like it. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m paid for. They don&rsquo;t know how I
      hate them. When they have their sweethearts and sisters up, they walk past
      me as though they never knew me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are they all like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, and I knew she loved him. When she spoke her voice trembled.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one of them is different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty, he&rsquo;s the one I came to talk about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With instinctive foreknowledge of the purpose of my errand, her face
      became tragic. &ldquo;His father&rsquo;s in India,&rdquo; I explained. &ldquo;From what I hear of
      him he&rsquo;s very proud. If the Bantam made a marriage that could in any way
      be regarded as imprudent, he&rsquo;d cut him off. He&rsquo;d be ruined. You know how
      it would be; the world would turn its back on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do we care about the world?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The world&rsquo;s a coward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was wonderful how coldly practical I could become in dealing with
      another man&rsquo;s heart affairs&mdash;I, who spent my time dreaming of the
      most extraordinarily unconventional marriages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world may be a coward, Kitty, but you have to live in it. Besides,
      are you sure that the Bantam really cares for you? Have you told him
      everything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stared into my eyes across the counter with frightened fascination. I
      knew that I was acting like a brute and I despised myself. I had hardly
      meant to ask her the last question&mdash;it had slipped out. While we
      gazed at one another there drifted through my memory all the scenes of
      that day at Richmond&mdash;the gaiety of it, and the hunger with which she
      had clutched me to her as we punted back in the dark. I understood what
      this little bit of love must mean to her after her experience of
      disillusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have not told him. I daren&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m afraid to lose him. Oh, Dante,
      don&rsquo;t tell him; it&rsquo;s my one last chance to be good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve got to tell him, Kitty. If his love&rsquo;s worth anything, he&rsquo;ll
      forgive you. He&rsquo;d be sure to find out after marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about marriage,&rdquo; she whispered desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even then, you ought to tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A customer came into the shop. We tumbled from our height of emotion. It
      was another example of how reality makes all things prosaic. She had to
      compose herself, and go and serve him. He had come to admire her and
      showed a tendency to dawdle. His purchase was the excuse for his presence.
      I had an opportunity to watch her&mdash;how charmingly fresh she looked
      and how girlish. And yet she was three years older than myself&mdash;that
      seemed incredible. At last the customer went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty, I feel I&rsquo;ve been a horrid beast to you&mdash;it&rsquo;s so often like
      that when one speaks the truth. I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt you. I want to see
      you happy. I&rsquo;ll not interfere. You must do what you feel to be right about
      it.&rdquo; And with that I left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bantam was rowing in the college crew that summer. What with training,
      going to bed early, and keeping up with his work, I saw little of him. The
      night before the races he came into my room. He looked brilliantly healthy&mdash;lean
      and tanned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can see I am. What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sank into a chair and grinned at me. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all up. I&rsquo;ve been an awful
      ass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wrote two letters; one to the widow at Torquay and the other to the
      actress. They were nice friendly letters, but far too personal. I put &rsquo;em
      in the wrong envelopes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they&rsquo;ve sent them back with bitter complaints against your
      infidelity. Poor old Bantam!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re keeping them as proof. They&rsquo;ve both struck out the
      same line of action and talk about a breach of promise suit. They&rsquo;re both
      coming to see me to-morrow, and they&rsquo;re sure to meet. There&rsquo;ll be a gay
      old row, and I shall get kicked out of Lazarus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I whistled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may well whistle,&rdquo; he said, ridiculously puckering his mouth; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a
      serious affair. Here have I been trying to be decent to two women, and
      they&rsquo;re going to try to make me out a kind of letter-writing Bluebeard. I
      know quite well I&rsquo;ve written silly things to them that could be construed
      in a horribly damaging manner. I only meant to be cheery, you know, but I
      see now that there&rsquo;ve been times when I&rsquo;ve crossed the boundary of mere
      friendship. They can both make a case against me I suspect and so can all
      the other girls. Once the thing leaks into the papers, they&rsquo;ll all swoop
      down like a lot of vultures to see what they can get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can run away to-night without leaving any address. That would leave the
      crew in the lurch; we&rsquo;d get bumped every night on the river&mdash;so I
      can&rsquo;t do that. I can stop and face it out&mdash;let my pater in for all
      kinds of expense in the way of damages, and get sent down. Or I can marry
      one of &rsquo;em, and so shut all the others&rsquo; mouths. It isn&rsquo;t money
      they&rsquo;re wanting&mdash;it&rsquo;s me as a husband. Isn&rsquo;t it a gay old world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pushed his hands deep into his trouser-pockets and thrust out his legs.
      He didn&rsquo;t seem adequately desperate&mdash;in fact he gave the impression
      of being glad this thing had happened. I was puzzling over what I ought to
      say to him, when it occurred to me that I hadn&rsquo;t offered any expression of
      sympathy; I told him I was awfully sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Needn&rsquo;t be. You see, there&rsquo;s only one girl I greatly care about, and
      she&rsquo;s just all the world. She had a mishap some years back with a cad&mdash;she
      only told me a month ago, and because of it she refused to marry me. She&rsquo;s
      got it into her head that I&rsquo;m too good for her. Well, now I can prove to
      her that it&rsquo;s the other way about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bantam ruffled his hair. He spoke with genuine feeling; this was quite
      different from any of his former confessions. He moistened his lips
      nervously, and turned away his eyes from me. &ldquo;There are some girls,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;who never need to be forgiven. Whatever they&rsquo;ve done and whatever
      they&rsquo;re doing, doesn&rsquo;t matter. They seem always too pure for us men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I leant forward and took his hand. I felt proud of him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stand by
      you, old chap. How can I help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By being awfully decent to these two women to-morrow. Take &rsquo;em out
      on the river and keep &rsquo;em quiet. Drug &rsquo;em with flattery.
      They&rsquo;re both of them immensely good-looking. P&rsquo;raps if you treat &rsquo;em
      well, they&rsquo;ll be ashamed to make a row. Then, when Eights&rsquo; Week is over
      and the crew doesn&rsquo;t want me any longer, I&rsquo;ll slip up to London, and
      establish a residence, and get married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he was going out of the room I called him back. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name of the
      girl you&rsquo;re going to marry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty,&rdquo; he whispered below his breath, as though it were a word too
      sacred to mention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The widow from Torquay arrived next morning; so did the actress from
      Putney. I let each one suppose that the other was my near relative, and
      never left them for a moment together, lest they should discover their
      error. I gave them separately to understand that their troubles would be
      satisfactorily settled. I made much of the rigors of training, which
      compelled the Bantam to absent himself. They didn&rsquo;t meet him until after
      they had seen him racing, by which time he had become a kind of hero to
      them. I saw them safely off at the station by different trains&mdash;so
      the crash was averted. When Eights&rsquo; Week was ended the Bantam vanished,
      without explanation to the college. A month later I attended his wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty had asked permission to invite one guest&mdash;she wouldn&rsquo;t tell us
      his name. When we three had assembled in the little Church of Old St.
      Mary&rsquo;s, Stoke Newington, who should come fussing up the aisle but my
      uncle, the Spuffler. He wore a frayed frock-coat; the end of his
      handkerchief was hanging out of his tail-pocket, as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      All through the service he gave himself such important airs that the
      clergyman took it for granted that the bride was his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      We jumped into a couple of hansoms and drove down to Verrey&rsquo;s to lunch.
      The Bantam said he knew he couldn&rsquo;t afford it, but he was determined to
      have one good meal before he busted. We had a private room set apart for
      us. The Spuffler tasted the best champagne he had drunk since his fiasco.
      It made him reflective. He kept on telling us that life was a switchback&mdash;an
      affair of ups and downs. The Bantam cut him short by proposing a toast to
      all the ladies he hadn&rsquo;t married. And I sat and stared at Kitty, with her
      cornflower eyes and sky-blue dress, and wondered where my eyes had been
      that I hadn&rsquo;t married her myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went to the Parks and took a boat on the Serpentine. It was there that
      the Bantam let his bomb burst: he was sailing on the <i>Celtic</i>, via
      New York, for Canada. He felt sure his father would disown him for having
      spoilt his Oxford opportunities, so he was going to start life afresh in a
      land where no one would remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the autumn, when I returned to Lazarus, I had an opportunity to judge
      how the world treats breakers of convention. No one had a good word to say
      for the Bantam. Everybody was eager to disclaim him as his friend&mdash;he
      had married a shop-girl. Yet Halloway, who sinned cavalierly without
      twinge of conscience or attempt at reparation, was spoken of, even by
      persons who had never known him, with a kind of tolerant, admiring
      affection. So much for what this taught me of social morality. Playing
      safe, and not ethical right or wrong, was the standard of conventional
      righteousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Star-dust days were drawing to an end. The grim, inevitable facts of life
      were looming larger and nearer. Romance was slowly giving way before
      reality. It was the last year at Oxford for most of the men in my set.
      Conversations began to take a practical turn, as to how a living might be
      earned. For myself, I listened with a languid interest. These discussions
      did not concern my future. I expected that my grandfather would continue
      my allowance. I should not be forced to sell myself by doing uncongenial,
      remunerative kinds of work. I should have time to mature. I wanted to make
      a study of the Renaissance. About twenty years hence I should publish a
      book; then I should be famous. Meanwhile I should collect my facts, and
      probably enter Parliament as member for Ransby.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was wonderful how bravely confident we were. We gazed into the future
      without fear or tremor. We all knew that we were sure of success. Already
      we were picking out the winners&mdash;the naturally great men, who would
      arrive at the top of the tree with the first effort. It was a belief among
      us that genius was nothing more than concentrated will-power. Then
      something happened which startled me into a novel display of energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever since leaving the Red House, the Creature had written me once a week,
      usually on a Sunday, with clockwork regularity. One Monday I went to the
      porter&rsquo;s lodge for my mail and missed his letter. The following morning,
      glancing down the paper, my eye was attracted by a headline which read,
      TRAGIC DEATH OF A SCHOOLMASTER. The news-item announced the death of Mr.
      Murdoch, science master of the Red House. It appeared that the boys had
      gone down to the laboratory to attend the experimental chemistry class. On
      opening the door they had been driven back by a powerful smell of gas, but
      not before they had caught a glimpse of Mr. Murdoch fallen in a heap upon
      the floor. When the room was entered it was quite evident that the death
      was not accidental. Every burner in the room was full on, and the
      ventilators were stopped with rags.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some days later I received a legal letter informing me that the Creature
      had left a will in my favor. His total estate amounted to three hundred
      pounds. I was requested to call at the lawyer&rsquo;s office. I got leave of
      absence from my college and went to London. There I learnt that at the
      time that the will had been made, a little over five years ago, the value
      of the estate had been a thousand pounds. Of this I had already received
      over seven hundred, remitted to me by his lawyers from time to time
      according to his instructions. He had originally saved the money in order
      that he might provide for his sister in the event of his dying first. On
      her death, he had executed the present will, making me his heir.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Sir Charles Evrard was not the author of my prosperity! The
      disappointment of the discovery robbed me for an instant of all sense of
      gratitude. I felt almost angry with the Creature for having been the
      innocent cause of all this building of air-castles. This was the second
      time that fortune had led me on to expect, only to trick me when the
      future seemed secure. The uncertainty of everything unnerved me. Life
      seemed to pucker its brows and stare down at me with a frown. All the
      money that had been spent on my education had taught me nothing
      immediately useful&mdash;and now I had a living to earn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily, just about this time, it was suggested to me that, after I had
      taken my Finals, I should enter for some of the history fellowships in the
      autumn. It was expected that I would gain an easy First; if I did that, I
      had a fair chance of winning a fellowship at my own college.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that my fool&rsquo;s paradise had melted into nothingness, I felt the spur
      of necessity, and commenced to work strenuously. Gradually a higher motive
      than the mere hope of reward began to actuate my energy. I wanted to be
      what the Creature had hoped for me. Now that he was gone, he became very
      near to me. He was always haunting my memory. He had robbed himself that
      he might give me my chance. I felt humbled that I should have spent his
      money with so free a hand, while he had been living in comparative
      poverty. I could picture just how he looked that morning when the boys
      burst into the laboratory. His hands were stained with chalk. His uncombed
      hair fell back from his wrinkled forehead. He was wearing the same old
      clothes&mdash;the tweed jacket and gray flannel trousers&mdash;that I knew
      so well. Probably he looked both tired and dirty, and a little
      disreputable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reproached myself for the shortness of my letters to him. I saw now, in
      the light of after events, how I might have been a strength to him. He had
      given me everything; I had given him nothing. His fineness of feeling had
      led him to prevent my gratitude. Never by the slightest hint had he left
      me room to guess that I was beholden to him. And now he was beyond reach
      of thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recalled how I had teased him as a youngster, and had courted popularity
      at his expense. When I was most angry against myself, I would drift back
      into the class-room where the boys were baiting him, and would hear him
      making his peace-offering, &ldquo;Penthil, Cardover? Penthil, Buzzard? Want a
      penthil?&rdquo; And then, in spite of indignation, I had to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Finals came on I won my First and in the autumn gained a history
      fellowship at Lazarus. It was worth two hundred pounds a year. It allowed
      me ample time to travel and was tenable for seven years, on the condition
      that I did not marry.

      CHAPTER I&mdash;I MEET HER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was June and
      wind was in the tree-tops. All the world was rustling and birds were
      calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the past seven months, since the winning of my fellowship, I had been
      over-working and making myself brain-sick with thought. I was
      twenty-three, and had arrived at &ldquo;the broken-toy age&rdquo; when a young man,
      having pulled this plaything of a universe to pieces, begins to doubt his
      own omniscience&mdash;his capacity to put it together. The more I sought
      help from philosophies, the more I came to see that they were all
      imperfect. No one had yet evolved a theory which had not at some point to
      be bridged by faith&mdash;that beautiful optimism which is nothing less
      than the hearsay of the heart. I was all for logic these days.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, when I heard the June wind laughing in the trees, I tossed my books
      aside. I left my doubts all disorderly upon the shelves to grow dusty, and
      ran away. I would seek for the garden without walls. Having failed to find
      it in libraries, I would search for it through the open country. I had
      only two certainties to guide me&mdash;that I was young, and that the
      world was growing lovelier every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I came down to quaint little Ransby, perched high and red above the old
      sea-wall. Life was taken so much for granted there. No one inquired into
      its why or wherefore. Everything that happened was accepted with a quiet
      stoicism, as &ldquo;sent from God.&rdquo; When the waves rumbled on the shore, they
      said the sea was talking to itself. When a crew sailed out and never
      returned, they said &ldquo;God took them.&rdquo; When times were bad, they looked back
      and remembered how times were worse before. No one ever really died there,
      for in the small interests of a quiet community nothing was forgotten&mdash;all
      the characteristic differences and shades of personality were treasured in
      memory, and so the dead lived on. Life for them was an affair of
      compensations. &ldquo;If there weren&rsquo;t no partin&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;d be no meetin&rsquo;s,&rdquo; my
      grandmother used to say. And death was explained after the same simple
      fashion. Every pious Ransbyite believed that heaven would be another
      Ransby, with no more storms and an empty churchyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      I traveled down from London by an afternoon train. Shortly after six we
      struck the Broads, or inland waterways, which now narrow into rivers, now
      widen into lakes, flowing sluggishly through fat marshes to the sea. On
      the left hand as we flashed by, one caught glimpses of the spread arms of
      windmills slowly turning, pumping meadows dry, or jutting above gray
      sedges the ochre-colored sails of wherries plodding like cart-horses from
      Ransby up to Norwich. Startled by the clamor of our passage, a lonely
      heron would spring up and float indignantly away into the distant quiet.
      Now we would come to a field of wheat faintly yellowing in the summer
      sunshine. Between green-gold stalks would flash the scarlet of the Suffolk
      poppy. Across the desecrated silence we hurled the grime and commotion of
      cities, leaving an ugly blur of gradually thinning smoke behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening glow was beginning. Picked out in gold, windows of thatched
      cottages and steeples of sleeping hamlets burnt for an instant splendid in
      the landscape. A child, warned of our approach, clambered on a stile, and
      waved; laborers, plodding homeward with scythes across their shoulders,
      halted to watch us go by. We burst as a disturbing element into the midst
      of these rustic lives; in our sullen hurry, they had hardly noticed us
      before we had vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the country fragrance of newly-mown hay there began to mingle the tar
      and salt of a seaport. We swayed across the tresseled bridge, where the
      Broads met the harbor. Ozone, smell of fish and sea-weed assailed our
      nostrils. Houses grew up about us. Blunt red chimneys, like misshapen
      thumbs, jabbed the blue of the horizon; above them tall masts of ships
      speared the sky. With rush and roar we invaded the ancient town, defiling
      its Dutch appearance of neatness, and affronting with our gadabout swagger
      its peaceful sense of home-abiding. We came to a standstill in the
      station; all was clatter and excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitors&rsquo; season was just commencing. The platform was crowded with
      Londoners greeting one another. Drawn up on the other side of the
      platform, parallel with the train, was a line of cabbies, most of whom
      were standing up in their seats, shouting and gesticulating. They had a
      touch of the sea about them&mdash;a weatherbeaten look of jolliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I got out, my eye was attracted to a little girl who was climbing down
      from a neighboring compartment. She was unlike any English child&mdash;she
      lacked the sturdy robustness. My attention was caught by the dainty
      faeriness of her appearance. She wore a foamy white muslin dress, cut very
      short, with spreading flounces of lace about it. It was caught up here and
      there with pink baby-bows of ribbon. Her delicate arms were bare from the
      elbow. She was small-boned and slender. Her skirt scarcely reached to her
      knees, so that nearly half her tiny height seemed to consist of legs. She
      had the slightness and moved with the grace of a child-dancer escaped from
      a ballet. But what completed her baby perfection was the profusion of
      flaxen curls, which streamed down from her shoulders to her waist. She saw
      me looking at her and laughed up with roguish frankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having secured my luggage, I was pushing my way out of the station through
      the long line of visitors and porters, when I saw the child standing
      bewildered by herself. In the crowd she had become separated from whoever
      was taking care of her. I spoke to her, but she was crying too bitterly to
      answer. Setting down my bags, I tried to comfort her, saying that I would
      stay with her till she was found. Suddenly her face lit up and she darted
      from my side. I had a hurried vision of a lady pushing her way towards
      her. While she was stooping to take the little girl in her arms, I made
      off as quickly as I was able. Like my father, I detested a scene, and had
      a morbid horror of being thanked.
    </p>
    <p>
      How good it was to smell the salt of the sea again. I passed up the harbor
      where the fishing-fleet lay moored against the quay-side, and sailormen,
      with hands deep in trouser-flaps, leant against whatever came handiest,
      pulling meditatively at short clay pipes. The business of the day was
      over. Folk were tenacious of their leisure in Ransby; they had a knack,
      peculiarly their own, of filling the evening with an undercurrent sense of
      gaiety. Though townsmen, they were villagers at heart. When work was done,
      they polished themselves up and sat outside their houses or came into the
      streets to exchange the news of the day. I turned from the harbor and
      passed down the snug quiet street in which stood the house with CARDOVER
      painted above the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I approached, the bake-house boy was putting the last shutter into
      place against the window. I entered the darkened shop on tiptoe, picking
      my way through anchors, sacks of ships&rsquo; biscuit, and coils of rope, till I
      could peer through the glass-panel of the door into the keeping-room. I
      loved to surprise the little old lady with the gray corkscrew curls and
      rosy cheeks, so that for once she might appear undignified. But, as I
      peered through, I met her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Dante, my boy,&rdquo; she cried, reaching up to put her arms round me,
      &ldquo;how you have grown!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was always a boy to her; she would never let herself think that I had
      ceased to grow, for then I should have ceased to be a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sat down to a typically Ransby meal, which they call high-tea. There
      were Ransby shrimps and Ransby bloaters on the table; everything was of
      local flavor, and most of it was home-made. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get things like
      them in Lun&rsquo;non,&rdquo; Grandmother Cardover said, falling back into her Suffolk
      dialect.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night we talked of Sir Charles Evrard. Rumor proclaimed that Lord
      Halloway had finally ruined his chances&rsquo; in that direction by his latest
      escapade. It concerned a pretty housemaid at Woadley Hall, and the affair
      had actually been carried on under Sir Charles&rsquo;s very nose, as one might
      say. The girl was the daughter of a gamekeeper on the estate and&mdash;&mdash;!
      Well there, my Grannie might as well tell me everything!&mdash;there was
      going to be a baby. All that was known for certain was that Mr. Thomas,
      the gamekeeper&mdash;a &lsquo;ighly respectable man, my dear&mdash;had gone up
      to the Hall with a whip in his hand and had asked to see Master Denny. The
      old Squire, hearing him at the door, had gone out to give him some
      instructions about the pheasantry. Mr. Thomas had given him a piece of his
      mind. And Sir Charles, having more than he could conveniently do with, had
      made a present to Denny Halloway of a bit of his mind. After which Master
      Denny had left hurriedly for parts unknown. It was said that he had
      returned to Oxford, to read for Holy Orders as a sort of atonement. It was
      my grandmother&rsquo;s opinion that the marriage-service wasn&rsquo;t much in his
      line.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we rambled on, and the underlying hint of it all was that I had come to
      Ransby in the nick of time to make hay while the sun was shining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grannie, you&rsquo;ll never get me worked up over that again,&rdquo; I told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well but, if his Lordship don&rsquo;t inherit, who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to?&rdquo; she persisted.
      &ldquo;I tell you, Dante, he&rsquo;s got to make you his heir&mdash;he can&rsquo;t help it.
      The whole town&rsquo;s talking about it. Sir Evrard&rsquo;s bailiff hisself was in
      here to-day and I says to him, &lsquo;Mr. Mobbs, who&rsquo;s going to be master now at
      Woadley Hall when the dear old Squire dies?&rsquo; And he answers me
      respectful-like, &lsquo;It don&rsquo;t do to be previous about such matters, Mrs.
      Cardover; but if you and me was to speak out our minds, I daresay we
      should guess the same.&rsquo; &lsquo;Is Sir Charles as wild with Lord Halloway as
      folks do say?&rsquo; I asks him. Like a prudent man he wouldn&rsquo;t commit hisself
      to words; but he throws up his hands and rolls his eyes. Now what d&rsquo;you
      think of that? If you knew Mobbs as I know him, you&rsquo;d see it was a sign
      which way the wind is blowing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was trying to think otherwise. I had banished this expectation from my
      mind and wasn&rsquo;t anxious to court another disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it happens that way, it will happen that way,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my grandmother wasn&rsquo;t in favor of such indifferent fatalism. She loved
      to picture me in possession of Woad-ley. She commenced to describe to me
      all its farmlands and broad acres. She spoke so much as if they were
      already mine that at last I began to dream again. So we rambled on until
      at five minutes to midnight the grandfather clock cleared its throat,
      getting ready to strike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawks-a-daisy me,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s that clock crocking for
      twelve! How you do get your poor old Grannie on talking!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We lit our candles and climbed the narrow stairs to bed. Outside my
      bedroom-door she halted. I wondered what else she had to tell me. Holding
      her candle high, so that its light fell down upon her laughing face, she
      made me a mocking courtesy, saying, &ldquo;Good-night, Sir Dante Card-over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next morning I was up early. As I dressed I could smell the bread being
      carried steaming out of the bakehouse. Looking out of my window into the
      red-brick courtyard I could see men&rsquo;s figures, white with flour-dust,
      going to and fro. The morning was clear and sparkling, as though washed
      clean by rain. The sun was dazzling and the wind was blowing. From the
      harbor came the creaking of sails being hoisted, and the cheery bustle of
      vessels getting under way. Of all places this was home. My spirits rose. I
      laughed, remembering the cobwebs of theories which had tangled up my
      brain. Nothing seemed to matter here, save the wholesome fact of being
      alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast I stepped out into the street and wandered up toward the
      harbor. The townsmen knew me and greeted me as I went by. I caught them
      looking after me with a new curiosity in their gaze. I began to wonder
      whether I had made some absurd mistake in my dressing. I grew
      uncomfortable and had an insane desire to see what kind of a spectacle my
      back presented. I tried to use shop-windows as mirrors, twisting my neck
      to catch glimpses of myself. Then there occurred to me what my grandmother
      had said to me on the previous night. So it <i>was</i> true, and all the
      town was talking about me!
    </p>
    <p>
      As I approached the chemist shop at the top of the road, Fenwick, the
      chemist, was sunning himself in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mr. Cardover!&rdquo; he exclaimed, stepping out on to the pavement and
      seizing my hand with unaccustomed effusiveness. Then, lowering his voice,
      &ldquo;Suppose you&rsquo;ve heard about Lord Halloway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky to be you,&rdquo; he added knowingly. &ldquo;But, there, I always did tell
      your Grannie that luck would turn your way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I passed on through the sunshine in a wild elation. What if it were true
      this time? I asked myself. What if it were really true?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransby is built like a bent arm, jutting out into the sea, following the
      line of the coast. At the extreme point of the elbow, where I was now
      standing, is the wooden pier, on which the visitors parade. Running from
      the elbow to the shoulder is the sheltered south beach and the esplanade,
      given up to visitors and boarding-houses. These terminate in the distance
      in a steep headland, on which stands the little village of Pakewold. On
      the other side of the pier is the harbor, entering or departing out of
      which fishing vessels and merchantmen may be seen almost any hour of the
      day. From the elbow to the finger tips, running northward, is the bleak
      north beach, gnawed at by the sea and bullied by every wind that blows.
      Here it is that most of the wrecks take place. The older portion of the
      town, climbing northward from the harbor, overhangs it, scarred and
      weather-beaten. Where the town ends, seven miles of crumbling gorse-grown
      cliff continue the barricade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Separating the town from the north beach, stretch the denes&mdash;a broad
      strip of grassy sand, on which fishing-nets are dried. Parallel with the
      denes is the gray sea-wall; and beyond the wall a shingle beach, low-lying
      and defended at intervals by breakwaters. Here the waves are continually
      attacking: on the calmest day there is anger in their moan. From far away
      one can hear the scream of pebbles dragged down as the waves recede, the
      long sigh which follows the weariness of defeat, and the loud thunder as
      the water hurls itself in a renewed attack along the coast. On the denes
      stands a lighthouse, warning vessels not to come too close; for, when the
      east wind lashes itself into a fury, the sea leaps the wall and pours
      across the denes to the foot of the town, like an invading host. A vessel
      caught in the tide-race at such a time, is flung far inland and left there
      stranded when the waves have gone back to their place. Facing the denes,
      lying several miles out in the German Ocean, are a line of sand-banks;
      between them and the shore is a channel, known as the Ransby Roads, which
      affords safe anchorage to vessels. Beyond the Roads and out of sight, lies
      the coast of Holland.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned my steps to the northward, passing through the harbor where
      groups of ear-ringed fisher-folk were unloading smacks, encouraging one
      another with hoarse, barbaric cries. I stopped now and then to listen to
      the musical sing-song conversation of East Anglia, so neighborly and so
      kindly. Here and there mounds of silver herring gleamed in the morning
      sunshine. The constant sound of ropes tip-tapping as the breeze stirred
      them, sails flapping and water washing against wooden piles, filled the
      air with the energy and adventure of sturdy life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exultation of living whipped the wildness in my veins. As I left the
      harbor, striking out across the denes, I caught the sound of breakers&mdash;the
      long, low rumble of revolt. Girls were at work, their hair tumbled, their
      skirts blown about, catching up nets spread out on the grass beneath their
      feet and mending the holes. Some of them were singing, some of them were
      laughing, some of them were silent, dreaming, perhaps, of sailor-lovers
      who were far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I advanced, I left all human sounds behind. The red town, piled high on
      the cliff, grew dwarfed in the distance. I entered into a world of nature
      and loneliness. Larks sprang from under my feet and rose into the air
      caroling. Overhead the besom of the wind was busy, sweeping the sky. From
      cliffs came the shy, old-fashioned fragrance of wall-flowers nestling in
      crannies. Yellow furze ran like a flame through the bracken. Far out from
      shore waves leapt and flashed, clapping their hands in the maddening
      sunshine. My cheeks were damp and my lips were salt with in-blown spray.
      It was one of those mornings of exultation which come to us rarely and
      only in youth, when the joy of the flesh is roused within us, we know not
      why, and every nerve is set tingling with health&mdash;and the world, as
      seen through our eyes, clothes itself afresh to symbolize the gay abandon
      of our mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fluttering of something white, low down by the water&rsquo;s edge, caught my
      attention. Out of sheer idleness I became curious. It was about a quarter
      of a mile distant when I first had sight of it. Just behind it lay the
      battered hull of an old wreck, masts shorn away and leaning over on its
      side. A sea-gull wheeled above the prow, flew out to sea and returned
      again, showing that it had been disturbed and was distressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I approached, I discovered the white thing to be the stooping figure of
      a child; by her hair I recognized her. Her skirts were kilted up about her
      tiny waist and she was bare-legged. I could see no one with her, so I
      waited till she should look up, lest I should frighten her. Then, &ldquo;Hulloa,
      little &lsquo;un,&rdquo; I shouted. &ldquo;Going to let me come and play with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spread apart her small legs, like an infant Napoleon, and brushed back
      the curls from her eyes. Her cheeks were flushed with exertion. She looked
      even prettier and more faery than she had on the previous night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you ith the man what found me!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made such speed as she could across the pebbles to greet me. It was
      hard going for her bare little feet. When she came opposite to me, she
      halted with a solemn childish air of dignity. &ldquo;I want to fank you,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;and tho doth Vi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood gazing at me shyly. When I bent down to take her hand in mine,
      she pursed her mouth, showing me what was expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked her what she was playing. She shook her curls, at a loss for
      words. &ldquo;Jest thomething,&rdquo; she said, and invited me to come and join.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took her in my arms to save her the rough return journey. She showed no
      fear of me. Soon we were chatting on the lonely beach, firm friends, quite
      gaily together. She showed me the channel she had scooped out, leading
      into the miniature harbor. Every time the surf ran up the shore the harbor
      filled with water. In the basin was a piece of wood, which floated when
      the surf ran in, and stranded when it receded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; I asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s our thip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name of our ship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fordet&mdash;it&rsquo;s the big thip in what we came over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, me and Vi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We set to work to make the harbor wider, going on our knees side by side.
      I thought of a fine plan&mdash;to start the ship at the beginning of the
      channel, that so it might ride in on the in-rush of the water. The little
      girl was delighted and leant over my shoulder, brushing my face with her
      blown about hair, and clapping her hands as she watched the success of the
      experiment. In the excitement of the game, we had forgotten about everyone
      but our two selves, when we heard a voice calling, &ldquo;Dorrie, darling!
      Dorrie, darling! Are you all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned round, but could see no one&mdash;only the lonely length of the
      shore and the black wreck blistering in the wind and sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yeth, I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; piped the little girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she explained to me, &ldquo;That wath Vi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who are you?&rdquo; I asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Dorrie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For me the zest had gone out of the game. I kept turning my head, trying
      to catch a glimpse of the owner of the voice. It had sounded so lazy and
      pleasant that I was anxious to see what Vi looked like; but then I was not
      sure that my company would prove so welcome to a grownup as it had to
      Dorrie. To run away would have looked foolish&mdash;as though there were
      something of which to be ashamed; and then there was nowhere to run to in
      that wide open space. Yet my intrusion was so unconventional that I did
      not feel comfortable in staying.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slim figure in a white sailor dress came out from the wreck. She had
      been bathing, for she wore neither shoes nor stockings, and her hair was
      hanging loose about her shoulders to dry. She started at sight of me, and
      seemed, for a moment, to hesitate as to whether she should retire. I rose
      from my knees, holding Dorrie&rsquo;s hand, and stood waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not help gazing at her; we looked straight into one another&rsquo;s
      eyes. Hers were the color of violets, grave and loyal. They seemed to
      stare right into my mind, reading all that I had thought and all that I
      had desired. Her face was of the brilliant and transparent paleness that
      goes with fair complexions sometimes. In contrast her lips were scarlet,
      and her brows delicately but firmly penciled. Her features were softly
      molded and regular, her figure upright and lithe. She appeared brimful of
      energy, a good deal of which was probably nervous. And her hair was
      glorious. It was flaxen like Dorrie&rsquo;s; the salt of the sea had given to it
      a bronzy touch in the shadows. She was neither short nor tall, but
      straight-limbed and superbly womanly. She possessed Dorrie&rsquo;s own fragile
      daintiness. The likeness between them was extraordinary; I judged them at
      once to be sisters. As for her age, she looked little more than twenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood gazing down on me from the sullen wreck, with La Gioconda&rsquo;s
      smile, incarnating all the purity of passion that I had ever dreamt should
      be mine. &ldquo;Gold and ivory, with poppies for her lips,&rdquo; was the thought that
      described her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorrie cut short our silence. Letting go my hand, she stumbled up the
      beach, explaining the situation in her lisping way. &ldquo;Deareth, thith
      gentleman hath been playing with me. He&rsquo;th the man what found me
      yetherday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noticing that neither of us uttered a word, she turned on me
      reproachfully. &ldquo;I thought you wath kind,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come thith minute,
      and thpeak to Vi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her air of baby imperiousness made us smile. That broke the ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She placed her arm about Dorrie, hugging her against her side. As I came
      up to the wreck, she held out her hand frankly. &ldquo;This is very
      unconventional,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but things sometimes happen this way. I was so
      sorry you wouldn&rsquo;t stop to let me thank you yesterday. I was hoping we
      would meet again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed quite natural to sit down beside this stranger. Usually in the
      presence of women I was tongue-tied and had to rack my brains to think
      what to say. When the opportunity to escape came, I always took it, and
      spent the next hour in kicking myself for having behaved like a frightened
      boy. On this occasion it was quite otherwise. Sprawled out in the shadow
      of the wreck, gazing up into her girlish face while she cuddled Dorrie to
      her, I found myself talking with a fearlessness and freedom which I was
      not aware of at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were bathing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook out her hair. &ldquo;Looks like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you shouldn&rsquo;t bathe here, you know. It&rsquo;s dangerous. The south beach
      is the proper place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather a good swimmer. I&rsquo;m not afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter. You oughtn&rsquo;t to do it. You might get drowned. I&rsquo;m
      awfully serious. I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed amused at my concern for her. Yet I knew she liked it. Her eyes
      were saying to me, &ldquo;Oh, you nice, funny boy! You&rsquo;ve known me less than an
      hour. If I were to drown, what difference would it make to you?&rdquo; She
      looked down at Dorrie. &ldquo;If Vi were to go out there, and sink beneath a
      wave, and never come back again, would Dorrie mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Dorrie; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be thtupid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We talked about a good many things that morning as the wind blew, and the
      waves broke, and the sun climbed higher. I wanted to find out who she was,
      so that I might make certain of meeting her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you live in Ransby?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. We only arrived yesterday. I never was in England till a week ago.
      We&rsquo;ve been traveling on the Continent. I wanted a place in which to be
      quiet. I heard someone in the hotel at which we stayed in London talking
      about Ransby. They said it was old-world and bracing&mdash;that was why I
      came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been out of England in my life,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to break
      loose some time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where would you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we began to talk of foreign countries, she amazed me with her
      knowledge. She seemed to have been in every country of Europe except
      Russia. Last winter, she told me, she had spent in Rome and the spring in
      Paris. She always spoke as if she had been unaccompanied, except for
      Dorrie. It struck me as strange that so young and beautiful a woman should
      have traveled so widely without an escort or chaperon of any kind. I was
      striving to place her. She spoke excellent English, and yet I was certain
      she was not an Englishwoman. For one thing, her manner in conversation
      with a man was too spontaneous and free from embarrassment. She had none
      of that fear of talking about herself which hampers the women of our
      nation; nor did she seek to flatter me and to hold my attention by an
      insincere interest in my own past history. She had an air of
      self-possession and self-poise which permitted her to make herself
      accessible. I longed to ask her to tell me more about herself, but I did
      not dare. We skimmed the surface of things, evading one another&rsquo;s
      inquisitiveness with veiled allusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child looked up. &ldquo;Dorrie&rsquo;s hungry,&rdquo; she said plaintively. .
    </p>
    <p>
      Pulling out my watch I discovered that it was long past twelve. Making the
      greatest haste, I could not get back to my grandmother&rsquo;s till lunch was
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t go unless you want,&rdquo; said Vi. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve enough for the three of
      us. It was Dorrie and I who delayed you; so we ought to entertain you.
      That&rsquo;s only fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dorrie wriggled her toes and clambered over me, insisting that I accept
      the invitation. And so I stayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They disappeared for ten minutes inside the wreck; when they came out they
      had completed their dressing. Vi had piled her hair into a gold wreath
      about her head. She was still hatless, but her feet were decorously
      stockinged and shod in a shiny pair of high-heeled slippers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the meal was ended, I had told myself, I ought to take my departure;
      but Dorrie gave me an excuse for stopping. She curled herself up in my
      arms, saying she was &ldquo;tho thleepy.&rdquo; I could not rise without waking her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the child no longer kept guard between us, we began to grow
      self-conscious. In the silences which broke up our whispered conversation,
      we took slow glances at one another and, when we caught one another&rsquo;s
      eyes, looked away sharply. I thought of the miracle of what had happened,
      and wondered if the same thought occupied her mind. Here were she and I,
      who that morning had been nothing to one another; by this afternoon every
      other interest had become dwarfed beside her. I knew nothing of her. Most
      of the words which we had interchanged had been quite ordinary. Yet she
      had revealed to me a new horizon; she had made me aware of an unsuspected
      intensity of manhood, which gave to the whole of life a richer tone and
      more poignant value.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took her eyes from the sea and looked down at Dorrie. &ldquo;You hold her
      very tenderly. You are fond of children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I am; but I didn&rsquo;t know it until I met your little sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A warm tide of color spread over her pale face and throat. She leant over
      me and kissed Dorrie. When the child opened her eyes she said, &ldquo;Come,
      darling, it&rsquo;s nearly time for tea. We must be going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I helped her to gather up her things, taking all the time I could in the
      hope that she would ask me to accompany her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She offered me her hand, saying, &ldquo;Perhaps we shall meet again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I hope so. Ransby is such a little place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but our movements are so uncertain. I don&rsquo;t know how long we may be
      staying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate we&rsquo;ve had a good time to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You have been very kind. I&rsquo;m sure Dorrie will remember you.
      Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I watched them grow smaller across the sands, till they entered into the
      shadow of the cliff. I had a mad impulse to pursue them&mdash;to follow
      them at a distance and find out where they lived. How did I know that they
      had not vanished forever out of my life? I called myself a fool for not
      having seized my opportunities, however precipitately, while they were
      mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wreck looked desolate now; all the romance had&rsquo; departed from it. The
      long emptiness of the shore filled me with loneliness. As I walked
      homeward, I strove to memorize her every tone and gesture. Their memory
      might be all that I should ever have of her. I was mortally afraid that we
      should never meet again.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II&mdash;I MEET HER AGAIN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>ext morning I
      walked along the north beach in the hope that I might catch sight of her.
      I was sure that she had shared my quickening of passion; it was because
      she had felt it and been frightened by it, that she had wakened Dorrie and
      hurried so abruptly away. I was sufficiently vain to assure myself that
      only the timidity of love could account for the sudden scurry of her
      flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      With incredible short-sightedness, I had allowed them to leave me without
      ascertaining their surname. My only clue, whereby I might trace them, was
      the abbreviated forms of their Christian names. Dorrie probably stood for
      Dorothy or Dorothea; Vi for Vivian or Violet. Directly after breakfast I
      had studied the visitors&rsquo; list in <i>The Ransby Chronicle</i>, hoping to
      come across these two Christian names in combination with the same
      surname. My search had been unrewarded, for only the initials of Christian
      names were printed and the V&rsquo;s and the D&rsquo;s were bewilderingly plentiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      On approaching the wreck I became oppressed with a nervous sense of the
      proprieties. I was ashamed of intruding myself again. If she were there,
      how should I excuse my coming? That attraction to her was my only motive
      would be all too plain. I had at my disposal none of the social cloaks of
      common interests and common acquaintance, which serve as a rule to
      disguise the primitive fact of a man&rsquo;s liking for a woman. The hypocrisy
      of pretending that a second meeting in the same place was accidental would
      be evident.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got there my fears proved groundless; nervousness was followed by
      disappointment. The shore was deserted. I called Dorrie&rsquo;s name to make my
      presence known; no answer came. Having reconnoitered the wreck from the
      outside, I entered through a hole in the prow where the beams had burst
      asunder. Then I knew that Vi had been there that morning. The surface of
      the sand which had drifted in had been disturbed. It was still wet in
      places from her bathing and bore the imprint of her footsteps, with
      smaller ones running beside them which were Dorrie&rsquo;s. I must have missed
      them by less than a hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning back to Ransby, I determined to spend the rest of the day in
      searching. Surely she must be conscious of my yearning&mdash;sooner or
      later, even against her inclination, it would draw her to me. Even now,
      somewhere in the pyramided streets and alleys of the red-roofed
      fishing-town, her steps were moving slower and her face was looking back;
      presently she would turn and come towards me.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that morning I wandered up and down the narrow streets, agitated by
      unreasonable hopes and fears. Ransby has one main thoroughfare: from
      Pakewold to the harbor it is known as the London Road; from the harbor to
      the upper lighthouse on the cliff it is known as the High Street. Leading
      off from the High Street precipitously to the denes are winding lanes of
      many steps, which are paved with flints; they are rarely more than five
      feet wide and run down steeply between gardens of houses. They make Ransby
      an easy place in which to hide. As I zigzagged to and fro between the
      denes and the High Street by these narrow passages, I was tormented with
      the thought that she might be crossing my path, time and again, without my
      knowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At lunch my grandmother inquired whether I had been to Woadley Hall. She
      had noticed how preoccupied I had been since my arrival, and attributed it
      to over-anxiety concerning my prospects with Sir Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best thing you can do, my dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is to go along out there
      this afternoon. I&rsquo;m not at all sure that you oughtn&rsquo;t to make yourself
      known at the Hall. At any rate, you&rsquo;ve only got to meet Sir Charles and
      he&rsquo;d know you directly. There&rsquo;s not an ounce of Cardover in you; you&rsquo;ve
      got your mother&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Falling in love is like committing crime; it tends to make you secretive.
      You will practise unusual deceptions and put yourself to all kinds of
      ridiculous inconvenience to keep the sweet and shameful fact, that a woman
      has attracted you, from becoming known. My grandmother had set her heart
      on my going to Woadley. There was no apparent reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t go.
      It would be much easier to make the journey, than to have to concoct some
      silly excuse for not having gone. So, with great reluctance, I set out,
      having determined to get there and back with every haste, so that I might
      have time to resume my search for Vi before nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been walking upwards of an hour and was descending a curving country
      lane, when I heard the smart trotting of a horse behind. The banks rose
      steeply on either side. The road was narrow and dusty. I clambered up the
      bank to the right among wild flowers to let the conveyance go by. It
      proved to be a two-wheeled governess-car, such as ply for hire by the
      Ransby Esplanade. In it were sitting Dorrie and Vi. Vi had her back
      towards me but, as they were passing, Dorrie caught sight of me. She
      commenced to shout and wave, crying, &ldquo;There he ith. There he ith.&rdquo; They
      were going too fast on the downgrade to draw up quickly, and so vanished
      round a bend. Then I heard that they had halted.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I came up with the conveyance, Dorrie reached out her arms impulsively
      and hugged me. She was all excitement. Before anything could be said, she
      began to scold me. &ldquo;Naughty man. I wanted you to play thips with me thith
      morning, like you did yetherday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was looking across the child&rsquo;s shoulder at Vi. Her color had risen. I
      could swear that beneath her gentle attitude of complete control her heart
      was beating wildly. Her eyes told a tale. They had a startled, frightened,
      glad expression, and were extremely bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have liked to play with you, little girl,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t
      know where you were staying. I looked for you this morning, but couldn&rsquo;t
      find you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dorrie seems to think that you belong to her,&rdquo; said Vi, in her laughing
      voice. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a little bit spoilt, you know. If she wants anything, she
      wants it badly. She can&rsquo;t wait. So, when we didn&rsquo;t run across you, she
      began to worry herself sick. If we hadn&rsquo;t found you, I expect there&rsquo;d have
      been an advertisement in to-morrow&rsquo;s paper for the young man who played
      ships with a little girl on the north beach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t go away again,&rdquo; coaxed Dorrie, patting my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you walking?&rdquo; asked Vi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Woadley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re going, so if you don&rsquo;t mind the squeeze, you&rsquo;d better
      get in and ride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A governess-car is made to seat four, but they have to be people of
      reasonable size. The driver&rsquo;s size was not reasonable. Good Ransby ale and
      a sedentary mode of life had swelled him out breadthwise, so that there
      was no room left on his side of the carriage except for a child;
      consequently I took my seat by Vi.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver thought he knew me, but was still a little doubtful in his
      mind. With honest, Suffolk downrightness, he immediately commenced to ask
      questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bain&rsquo;t a Ransby man, be you, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a half-and-half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought I couldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; been mistooken. I&rsquo;ve lived in Ransby man
      and boy, and I never forgets a face. Which &rsquo;alf of you might be
      Ransby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Ransby all through on my parents&rsquo; side, but I&rsquo;ve lived away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you bain&rsquo;t Mr. Cardover, be you&mdash;gran&rsquo;son to old Sir Charles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve guessed right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I never! And to think that you should be goin&rsquo; to Woadley! Why, I
      knew your Ma well, Mr. Cardover; The gay Miss Fannie Evrard, we called &rsquo;er.
      Meanin&rsquo; no disrespec&rsquo; to you, sir, I was groom to Miss Fannie all them
      years ago, before she run away with your father. She were as nice and kind
      a mistress as ever a man might &rsquo;ope to find. It&rsquo;s proud I am to
      meet you this day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As we bowled along through the leafy country, all shadows and sunshine, he
      fell to telling me about my mother, and I was glad to listen to what he
      had to say. The story had been told often before. By his inside knowledge
      of the elopement, he had acquired that kind of local importance which
      money cannot buy. It had provided him with the one gleam of lawless
      romance that had kindled up the whole of his otherwise dull life.
      According to his account, the marriage would never have come off, unless
      he had connived at the courting. My mother, he said, took him into her
      confidence, and he was the messenger between her and my father. He would
      let my father know in which direction they intended to ride. When they
      came to the place of trysting, he would drop behind and my mother would go
      on alone. He pointed with his whip to some of the meeting-places with an
      air of pride. He was godfather, as you might say, to the elopement. After
      it had taken place, Sir Charles had discovered his share in it, and had
      dismissed him. The word had gone the round among the county gentry&mdash;he
      had never been able to find another situation. So he had bought himself a
      governess-car and pony, and had plied for hire. &ldquo;And I bain&rsquo;t sorry, sir,&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;If it were to do again, I should be on the lovers&rsquo; side. I&rsquo;m
      only sorry I &rsquo;ad to take to drivin&rsquo; instead o&rsquo; ridin&rsquo;; it makes a
      feller so &rsquo;eavy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vi laughed at me out of the corners of her eyes. She had listened
      intently. I felt, without her telling me, that this little glimpse into my
      private history had roused her kindness. And the affair had its comic side&mdash;that
      this mountain of flesh sitting opposite should be my first ambassador to
      her, bearing my credentials of respectability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha&rsquo; ye heerd about Lord Halloway?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded curtly. Encouraged by my former sympathetic attention, he failed
      to take the intended warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s a young rascal for ye, for all &rsquo;e &rsquo;olds &rsquo;is
      &rsquo;ead so &rsquo;igh! Looks more&rsquo;n likely now that you&rsquo;ll be the
      nex&rsquo; master o&rsquo; Woadley. Doan&rsquo;t it strike you that way, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I maintained silence, he carried on a monologue with himself. &ldquo;And &rsquo;e
      war goin&rsquo; to Woadley, he war. And I picks &rsquo;un up by h&rsquo;axcident
      like. And I war groom to &rsquo;is ma. Wery strange!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But there were stranger things than that, to my way of thinking: and the
      strangest of all was my own condition of mind. A golden, somnolent content
      had come over me, as though my life had broken off short, and commenced
      afresh on a higher plane. Every motive I had ever had for good was
      strengthened. The old grinding problems were either solved or seemed
      negligible. I saw existence in its largeness of opportunity, and I saw its
      opportunity in a woman&rsquo;s eyes. It was as though I had been colorblind, and
      had been suddenly gifted with sight so penetrating that it enabled me to
      look into exquisite distances and there discern all the subtle and
      marvelous disintegrations of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the car swung round corners or rattled over rough places, our bodies
      were thrown into closer contact as we sat together, Vi and I. Now her
      shoulder would lurch against mine; now she would throw out her hand to
      steady herself, and I would wonder at its smallness. I watched the demure
      sweetness of her profile, and how the sun and shadows played tricks with
      her face and throat. The fragrance of her hair came to me. I followed the
      designed daintiness of the little gold curls that clustered with such
      apparent carelessness against the whiteness of her forehead. I noticed the
      flicker of the long lashes which hid and revealed her eyes. How perishable
      she was, like a white hyacinth, or a summer&rsquo;s morning&mdash;and how
      remotely divine.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the tantalizing fascination of it all was that I must be restrained.
      She might escape me any day.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a hollow of the country from between the hedges, Woadley crept into
      sight. First we saw the gray Norman tower of the church, smothered in ivy;
      then the thatched roofs of the outlying cottages; then the sun-flecked
      whiteness of the village-walls, with tall sunflowers and hollyhocks
      peeping over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we passed the churchyard the driver slowed down. &ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s the last place
      your father met &rsquo;er, Mr. Cardover, before they run away. It war a
      summer evenin&rsquo; about this time o&rsquo; the year, and they stayed for upwards o&rsquo;
      an hour together in the porch. She&rsquo;d told old Sir Charles that she war
      goin&rsquo; to put flowers on &rsquo;er mawther&rsquo;s grave. Aye, but she looked
      beautiful; she war a fine figure o&rsquo; a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him I would alight there. He was closing the door, on the point of
      driving on, when I said to Vi, &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to get out as well? The
      church is worth a visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave me her hand and I helped her down. The governess-car went forward
      to the village inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been scything the grass in the churchyard and the air was full of
      its cool fragrance. Dorrie ran off to gather daisies in a corner where it
      still stood rank and high.
    </p>
    <p>
      We walked up the path together to the porch and tried the door. It was
      locked. We turned away into the sunlight, where dog-roses climbed over
      neglected graves and black-birds fluttered from headstones to bushes, from
      bushes to the moss-covered surrounding walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Vi who broke the pleasant silence. &ldquo;I hope you didn&rsquo;t mind the man
      talking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. I expect I should have told you myself by and by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother must have been very beautiful. I like to think of her. All
      this country seems so different now I know about her; it was so impersonal
      before. Was&mdash;was she happy afterwards?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told her. I told her much more than I realized at the time. So few
      people had ever cared to hear me talk about her, and for all of them she
      was something past&mdash;dead and gone. My grandmother talked of her as a
      lottery-ticket; so did the Spuffler; at home we never mentioned her at
      all. Yet always she had been a real presence in my life. I felt jealous
      for her; it seemed to me that she must be glad when we, whom she had
      loved, remembered her with kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorrie came back to us with her lap full of flowers. Seeing that we were
      talking seriously, she seated herself quietly beside us and commenced to
      weave the flowers into a chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gate creaked. Footsteps came up the path. They paused; seemed to
      hesitate; came forward again. Behind us they halted. Turning my head, I
      saw an erect old man, white-haired, standing hat in hand, his back toward
      us, regarding a weather-beaten grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      We rose, instinctively feeling our presence irreverent. My eye caught the
      name on the headstone of the grave:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      MARY FRANCES EVRARD
    </h3>
    <h3>
      BELOVED WIFE OF SIR CHARLES EVRARD
    </h3>
    <h3>
      OF WOADLEY HALL
    </h3>
    <p>
      The old gentleman put on his hat, preparing to move away. Recognizing our
      intention to give him privacy, he turned and bowed with stiff,
      old-fashioned courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gazed on him fascinated. It was the first time I had seen my
      grandfather. His eyes fell full on my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      His was one of the most remarkable faces I have ever gazed on. He was
      clean shaven; his skin was ashy. His features were ascetic, boldly
      chiseled and yet sensitively fine. They seemed to remodel themselves with
      startling rapidity to express the thought that was passing in his mind.
      The forehead was bony, high, and wrinkled. The nose was large-nostriled
      and aquiline. The eye-brows were shaggy; beneath them burnt sparks of
      fire, steady and almost cruel in their scorching penetration. From the
      nostrils to the corners of the mouth two heavy lines cut deep into the
      flesh, creating an expression of haughty contemplation and aloof sadness.
      The mouth was prominent, fulllipped, and almost sensual, had it not been
      so delicately shaped. The chin was long, pointed, and sank into the
      breast. It was an actor&rsquo;s face, a poet&rsquo;s face, a rejected prophet&rsquo;s face,
      according to the mood which animated it. When the lines deepened into
      sneering melancholy and the corners of the large mouth drooped, it became
      almost Jewish. The strong will that was always striving to cast the
      outward appearance into an expression of immobile pride, was continually
      being thwarted by the man&rsquo;s quivering, abnormal capacity to feel and to be
      wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at me in troubled amazement. Yearning, despairing tenderness
      fought its way into his eyes; for an instant, his whole expression relaxed
      and softened. He had recognized my mother in me and was remembering. He
      made a step towards me. Then his face went rigid again. The skin drew
      tight over the cheek-bones. Setting his hat firmly on his head, he turned
      upon his heel. At the gate he looked back once, against his will. Then he
      passed out resolutely and vanished down the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twilight was gathering as we drove back to Ransby. Rays of the sun crept
      away from us westward through the meadows, like golden snakes. Vi and I
      were silent&mdash;the presence of the driver put a constraint upon us.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a good deal to say, for he had warned all the village of my
      arrival, and all the village, furtively from behind curtained windows, had
      watched Sir Charles&rsquo;s journey to and from the churchyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been pleasant at the inn to hear myself addressed as &ldquo;Miss Fannie&rsquo;s
      son.&rdquo; The windows of the low-ceilinged room in which we had had our tea,
      faced out on the tall iron gates which gave entrance to the park. Far up
      the driveway, hidden behind elms, we had just caught a glimpse of Woadley
      Hall. And all the while we were eating, the broad-hipped landlady had
      stood guard over us, talking about my mother and the good old days. She
      had mistaken Vi for my wife at first; in speaking to Dorrie she had
      referred to me as &ldquo;your Papa.&rdquo; Up to the last she had persisted in
      including Vi and Dorrie in her prophecies for my future. She never doubted
      that Vi and I were engaged. She assured us that she &rsquo;oped to see us
      at the &rsquo;All one day, and a &rsquo;andsome couple we would make.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time we had been abashed by her conversation, and had drunk our tea
      in flustered fashion with our eyes in our cups. We had hated this big
      complacent person for her clumsy, interfering kindness. But now, as the
      little carriage threaded its way through dusky lanes, her errors gave rise
      to a pleasant train of imaginings. I saw Vi as my wife&mdash;as Lady
      Cardover, mistress of Woadley Hall. I planned the doings of our days, from
      the horse-back ride in the early morning to the quiet evenings together by
      the cozy fire. And why could it not be possible?
    </p>
    <p>
      Country lovers, unashamed, with arms encircling one another, drew aside to
      let us pass, as our lamps flashed down the road. Night birds were calling.
      Meadowsweet and wild thyme spread their fragrance abroad. As the wind blew
      inland, between great silences, it carried to our ears the moan of the
      sea. While twilight hovered in the open spaces Dorrie, since no one talked
      to her, kept up an undercurrent song:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;How far is it to Babylon?
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      <i>Three score miles and ten</i>.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Can I get there by candlelight?
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      <i>Ah yes,&mdash;and back again.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      As night crept on, the piping little voice grew indistinct and murmurous,
      like a bee humming; the fair little head nodded and sank against the arm
      of the bulky driver. Vi leant forward to lift her into her lap; but I took
      Dorrie from her. With the child in my arms, for the first time the desire
      to be a father came over me. In thinking of what love might mean, I had
      never thought of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      We entered Ransby at the top of the High Street and drew up outside an old
      black flint house. Vi got out first and rang the bell. When the door
      opened, I put Dorrie into her arms. I bent over and kissed the sleeping
      child. Vi drew back her head sharply; my lips had passed so near to hers.
      We faced one another on the threshold. The light from the hall, falling on
      her face, showed me that her lips were parted as though she had something
      that she was trying to get said. Then, &ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo; she whispered, and
      the door closed behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I crossed the street and wandered to and fro, watching the house. All the
      front was in darkness; her rooms must be at the back. I was greedy for her
      presence; if I could only see her shadow pass before a window I would be
      content. With the closing of the door, she seemed to have shut me out of
      her life. There was so much to say, and nothing had been said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned out of the High Street down a long dark score, toward the beach.
      Walls rose tall on either side. The salt wind, hurrying up the narrow
      passage, struck me in the face and caused the gas-lamps to quiver. Far
      down the tunnel at the end of the steps lay a belt of blackness, and
      beyond that the tossing lights of ships at sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching the Beach Road, I passed over the denes. The town stretched tall
      across the sky, like a shadowy curtain through which peered golden eyes.
      The revolving light of the lighthouse on the denes pointed a long white
      finger inland, till its tip rested on the back of Vi&rsquo;s house. I fancied I
      saw her figure at the window. The finger swept on in a circle out to sea,
      leaving the town in darkness. The upper-light on the cliff replied,
      pointing to the place where I was standing, making it bright as day. If
      she were still at the window, she would be able to see me as I had seen
      her. Next time her window was illumined she had vanished. I watched and
      waited; she did not return.
    </p>
    <p>
      I roamed along the shore towards the harbor, purposeless with desire. The
      sea, like a blind old man, kept whimpering to itself, trying to drag
      itself up the beach, clutching at the sand with exhausted fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wearied out with wandering, I turned my steps homeward. The shop looked so
      dark that I was ashamed to ring the bell lest they had all retired. I
      tapped on the shutters, and heard a shuffling inside; my grandmother
      opened the door to me. She was in her dressing-gown and a turkey-red
      petticoat. The servant had been in bed some hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the keeping-room I found a supper spread. Instead of being annoyed, she
      was bubbling over with excitement. She could not sit down, but stood over
      my chair while I ate; she was sure something wonderful had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you saw Sir Charles, my boy, and he recognized you! Tell me
      everything, chapter and verse, with all the frills and furbelows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had not much that I could tell, but I spread it out to satisfy her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did you think of &rsquo;im?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he every inch
      the aristocrat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But why is he so dark? There are times when he looks almost Jewish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my dear, that&rsquo;s &lsquo;cause he&rsquo;s got gipsy-blood. His mother was one of
      the Goliaths. Didn&rsquo;t your father ever tell you that? Seems to me he don&rsquo;t
      tell you nothing. You have to come to your poor old Grannie to learn
      anything. Why, yes, old Sir Oliver Evrard, his father, your
      greatgrandfather, fell in love with a gipsy fortune-teller and married &rsquo;er.
      Ever since then the gipsies have been allowed to camp on Woadley Ham. They
      do say that it was the wild gipsy streak that made your mother do what she
      did. But there&mdash;that&rsquo;s a long story. It&rsquo;ll keep. We&rsquo;d better go to
      bed.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III&mdash;FATE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> could not
      understand Vi. It would seem that she was trying to avoid me. If I met her
      in the street she was usually driving and, while she bowed and smiled,
      never halted. I took many strolls by her house, hoping to catch her going
      in or out. I think she must have watched me. Once only, when she thought
      the coast was clear, I came upon her just as she was leaving the house.
      She saw me and flushed gloriously; then pretended that she had not seen me
      and re-entered, closing the door hurriedly behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that I gave up my pursuit of her. It seemed not straightforward&mdash;too
      much like spying. I kept away from the places she was likely to frequent.
      Wandering the quays, where there were only sailors and red-capped Brittany
      onion-sellers, I racked my brains, trying to recall in what I had
      offended. I felt no resentment for Vi&rsquo;s conduct. It never occurred to me
      that she was a coquette. I thought that she might be actuated by a woman&rsquo;s
      caution, and gave her credit for motives of which I had no knowledge. The
      more she withdrew beyond my attainment, the more desirable she became to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandmother noticed my fallen countenance and concluded that Sir
      Charles&rsquo;s indifference was the cause of it. She tried to cheer me with
      fragments of wise sayings which had helped her to keep her courage. She
      told me that there were more fish in the sea than ever came out of it. She
      even feigned contempt for Sir Charles, saying that I should probably be
      just as happy without his begrudged money. She resorted to religion for
      comfort, saying that if God didn&rsquo;t intend me to inherit Woadley, it was
      because it wouldn&rsquo;t be good for me. She painted for me the pleasures of
      the contented life:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;No riches I covet, no glory I want,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      H&rsquo;ambition is nothing to me;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The one thing I beg of kind &rsquo;eaven to grant
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Is a mind independent and free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But she couldn&rsquo;t stir me out of my melancholy, for she didn&rsquo;t know its
      cause. She physicked me for financial disappointments; what I wanted was a
      love-antidote.
    </p>
    <p>
      As my whole energies had formerly been bent on encountering Vi, so now
      they were directed towards avoiding her. For hours I would lounge in the
      bake-house or sit in the shop while Grandmother Cardover did her knitting,
      served customers, or gossiped with her neighbors. Then, against my better
      judgment, curiosity and longing for one more glimpse of her would drag me
      out into the streets, Yet, once in the streets, my chief object was to
      flee from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now when I should have refrained from pestering her, some obstinate fate
      was always bringing us face to face. I was sorriest for the effect that
      our attitude was having on Dorrie. At first she would rush forward in a
      gale of high spirits to greet me, until restrained by Vi. Next time, with
      a child&rsquo;s forgetfulness, she would lift to me her pansy-face smiling, and
      remembering would hang back. At last she grew afraid of my troubled looks,
      and would hide shyly behind Vi&rsquo;s skirts when she saw me.
    </p>
    <p>
      For five days I had not met them. A desperate suspicion that they had left
      town grew upon me. I became reckless in my desire for certainty. I could
      not bear the suspense. I was half-minded to call at the house where she
      had been staying, but that did not seem fair to her. I called myself a
      fool for not having stopped her in the street while I had the chance, when
      an explanation and an apology might have set everything on a proper
      footing.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the sixth morning of her absence I rose early and went out before
      breakfast. The skies were gray and squally. A slow drizzle had been
      falling all night and, though it now had ceased, the pavements were wet.
      The wind came in gusts, whistling round corners of streets and houses,
      whirling scraps of paper high in the air. When I came to the harbor, I saw
      that the sea was choppy and studded with white horses. Against the piles
      of the pier waves were dashing and shattering into spray. From up channel,
      all along the horizon, drove long lines of leaden clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      I struck out across the denes between the sea-wall and the Beach Road. No
      one was about. I braced myself against the wind, enjoying its stinging
      coldness. The tormented loneliness of the scene was in accord with my
      mood. The old town, hanging red along the cliff, no longer seemed to watch
      me; it frowned out on the desolate waste of water in impersonal defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      My thoughts were full of that first morning when I had met her. I gave my
      imagination over without restraint to reconstructing its sensuous beauty.
      I saw the fire of the furze again, and scented the far-blown fragrance of
      wall-flowers, hiding in their crannies. But I saw as the center of it all
      the slim white girl with the mantle of golden hair, the deep inscrutable
      eyes of violet, and the slow sweet smile of <i>La Gioconda</i> playing
      round the edges of her mouth: gold and ivory, with poppies for her lips
      and sunshine for a background.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hot blood in me was up&mdash;the gipsy blood. A stream of impassioned
      fancies passed before me. Ah, if I were to meet her now, I would have done
      with fine-spun theories of what was gentlemanly. On the lonely beach I
      would throw my arms about her, however she struggled, and hold her fast
      till she lay with her dear face looking up, crushed and submissive in my
      breast. After that she might leave me, but she would at least have learnt
      that I was a man and that I loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ahead lay the sullen wreck. I had been there only once since our first
      meeting. Motives of delicacy, which I now regretted, had held me back. Now
      I could go there. On such a morning, though she were still in Ransby,
      there would be no fear of surprising her.
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering the hull through the hole in the prow, the wind ceased, though
      it whistled overhead. I leant against the walls of the stranded ship,
      recovering my breath. I. drew out my pipe, intending to take a smoke while
      I rested. As I turned to strike a match, an open umbrella lying in a
      corner on the sand, caught my attention. I went over and looked behind it;
      there lay a pair of woman&rsquo;s shoes and stockings, and a jacket, with stones
      placed on it to keep it down. Beneath the jacket was a disordered pile of
      woman&rsquo;s clothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first thought was shame of what she might think of me, were she to find
      me. My second was of angry fear because she had been so foolhardy as to
      bathe from such a shore on such a morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hurrying out of the wreck, I strode across the beach to where the surf
      rushed boiling up the pebbles. The waves ran high, white, and foam-capped,
      hammering against the land. Gazing out from shore, I could see nothing but
      leaden water, rising and falling, rising and falling. The height of the
      waves might hide a swimmer from one standing at the water&rsquo;s level; I raced
      back up the beach, and climbed the wreck. I could not discover her. The
      horror of what this meant stunned me; I could think of nothing else. My
      mind was in confusion. Then I heard my voice repeating over and over that
      she was not dead. The sheer monotony of the reiterated assertion, produced
      a sudden, unnatural clearness. &ldquo;If she is not drowned, she must be
      somewhere out there,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I commenced to sweep the sea with my eyes in ever widening circles. Two
      hundred yards down the shore to the left and about fifty out, I sighted
      something. It was white and seemed only foam at first. The crest of a wave
      tossed it high for a second, then shut it out; when the next wave rose it
      was still there.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shouted, but my voice would not carry against the wind. The next time
      the white thing rose on the crest I was sure that it was the face of a
      woman. I saw her arm thrown out above the surface; she was swimming the
      overarm stroke in an effort to make headway toward the land. I knew that
      she could never do it, for the current along the north beach runs seawards
      and the tide was going out. I gazed round in panic. The shore was forlorn
      and deserted. Behind me to the northward stretched the gaunt, bare cliffs.
      To the southward, a mile distant across the denes, stood the outskirts of
      the sleepy town. Before ever I could bring help, she would have been
      carried exhausted far out to sea, or else drowned. There was no boat on
      the shore between myself and the harbor. There was nothing between her and
      death but myself. And to go to her rescue meant death.
    </p>
    <p>
      I scarcely know what happened. I became furious with unreasonable anger. I
      was angry with her for her folly, and angry with the world because it took
      no notice and did not care. I was determined that, before it was too late,
      I would go to her, so that she might understand. Yet, despite my passion,
      I acted with calculation and cunning. All my attention was focused on that
      speck of white, bobbing in the waste of churned up blackness. As I ran
      along the beach I kept my eyes fixed on that. When I came opposite, I
      waved to it. It took no notice. I hurried on a hundred yards further; the
      current would bear her down towards me northwards. I stripped almost
      naked, tearing off everything that would weigh me down. I waded knee-deep
      into the surf, up to where the beach shelved suddenly. I waited till a
      roller was on the point of breaking; diving through it, I struck out.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was difficult to see her. Only when the waves threw us high at the same
      moment, did I catch a glimpse of her and get my direction. The shock of
      the icy coldness of the water steadied my nerves and concentrated my
      purpose. I was governed by a single determination&mdash;to get to her. My
      thought went no further than that. Nothing else mattered. I had no fear of
      death or of what might come after&mdash;I had no time to think about it. I
      wanted to get her in my arms and shake her, and tell her what a little
      fool she was, and kiss her on the mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lying on my right side, keeping low in the water, I dug my way forward
      with an over-arm left-stroke. As my first wind went from me and I waited
      for my second, I settled down into the long plugging stroke of a mile
      race. The tide was with me, but the roughness of the water prevented rapid
      progress. I had to get far enough out to be at the point below her in the
      current to which she was being swept down.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started counting from one to ten to keep myself from slackening, just as
      the cox of a racing-eight does when he forces his crew to swing out. I
      regarded my body impersonally, without sympathy, as though we were
      separate. When it suffered and the muscles ached, I lashed it forward with
      my will, silently deriding it with brutal profanities. The wind poured
      over the sea; the spray dashed up and nearly choked me. It was difficult
      to keep her in sight. When I saw her again, I smiled grimly at her courage
      and hit up a quicker pace. Who would have thought that her fragile body,
      so flower-like and dainty, had the strength and nerve to fight like that?
    </p>
    <p>
      I was far enough out now to catch her. I halted, treading water; but the
      inaction gave my imagination time to get to work, and, when that happened,
      I felt myself weakening. I started up against the current, going parallel
      with the beach, to meet her. The one obsessing thought in my mind was to
      get to her. It was not so much a thought as an animal instinct. I was
      reduced to the primitive man, brutally battling his way towards his mate
      at a time of danger. While I acted instinctively, the flesh responded;
      directly I paused to think, my body began to shirk and my strength to ebb.
      Somewhere in that raging waste of water I must find and touch her. I did
      not care to hear her voice&mdash;simply to hold her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirty feet away a gray riot of stampeding water rose against the horizon;
      in it I saw her face. With the swift trudging stroke of a polo-player I
      made towards her. In the foam and spray I saw what looked like golden
      seaweed. She was drifting past me; I caught her by the hair. Out of the
      mist of driven chaos we gazed in one another&rsquo;s eyes. Her lips moved.
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mind was laughing in triumph. My body was no longer weary&mdash;it was
      forgotten and strong again. In all the world there were just she and I.
      She had tried to escape me, but now the waves jostled us together. She had
      striven not to see me, but now my face focused all her gaze. She might
      look away into the smoking crest of the next roller, but her eyes must
      always come back. Of all live things we had loved or hated, now there
      remained just she and I. We had been stripped of all our acquirements and
      thrown back to the primitive basis of existence&mdash;a man and a woman
      fighting for life in chaos. For us all the careful conventions, built up
      by centuries, were suddenly destroyed. The polite decencies and safeguards
      of civilization were swept aside. The shame of so many natural things,
      which had made up the toll of our refinement, was contemptuously blotted
      out&mdash;the architecture of the ages was shattered in an instant. We
      were thrown back to where the first man and woman started. The only virtue
      that remained to us was the physical strength by which death might be
      avoided. The sole distinguishing characteristic between us was the
      female&rsquo;s dependence on the male, and the male&rsquo;s native instinct to protect
      her, if need be savagely with his life. Over there, a mile away, stood the
      red comfortable town on the cliff, where all the smug decencies were
      respected which we had perforce abandoned. Between us and the shore
      stretched fifty yards of water&mdash;a gulf between the finite and the
      infinite. Over there lay the moment of the present; here in eternity were
      she and I.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gazed on her with stern gladness; I had got to her&mdash;she was mine.
      The madness for possession, which had given me strength, was satisfied.
      Now a fresh motive, still instinctive and primal, urged me on&mdash;I must
      save her. I lifted her arm and placed it across my shoulder, so that I
      might support her. The great thing was to keep her afloat as long as
      possible. There was no going back over the path that we had traversed&mdash;both
      tide and current were dead against us. Already the shore was stealing away&mdash;we
      were being carried out to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remembered, how on that first morning, when I had warned her against
      bathing from the north beach, she had told me she was a good swimmer. In
      my all-embracing ignorance of her, I had no means of estimating how much
      or how little that meant. For myself, barring accidents, I judged I could
      keep going for two hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vi was weakening. With her free left hand she was still swimming pluckily,
      but her right hand kept slipping off my shoulder; I had to watch her
      sharply and lift it back. Her weight became heavier. Her lips were blue
      and chattering. I noticed that her fingers were spread apart; she had
      cramp in the palms of her hands. Her body dragged beside me; she was
      losing control of it. She was no longer kicking out.
    </p>
    <p>
      To talk, save in monosyllables, was impossible, and then one had to shout.
      Our ears were stopped up with water; the clash of the wind against the
      waves was deafening. My one fear for her was that the cramp would spread.
      If that happened, we would go down together.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt her cold lips pressed against my shoulder. As I looked round, she
      let go of me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m done,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went under. I slipped my arm about her and turned over on my back, so
      that my body floated under her, and she lay across my breast. &ldquo;You shan&rsquo;t
      go,&rdquo; I panted furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me,&rdquo; she pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I held her. &ldquo;You shan&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      My anger roused her. I turned over again, swimming the breast-stroke. She
      placed her arm round my neck. Her long hair washed about me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes her eyes were closed and I thought she had fainted. Her lips had
      ceased to chatter. Her face lay against my shoulder, pinched and quiet as
      though she were dead. My own motions were becoming mechanical. It was
      sheer lust of life that kept me going. I had lost sensation in my feet and
      hands. The shore had dwindled behind us; it seemed very small and blurred,
      though it was probably only half-a-mile distant. The water was less
      turbulent now; it rose and fell, rose and fell, with a rocking
      restfulness. I felt that I would soon be sleeping soundly. But in the
      midst of drowsing, my mind would spring up alert and I would drag her arm
      closer about my neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above the clamor of the waves I heard a shout. At first I thought that I
      had given it myself. I heard it again; it was unmistakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking up out of the trough of a wave, I saw a patched sail hanging over
      us. My sight was misty; the sail was indistinct and yet near me. As I rose
      on the crest, a hand grabbed me and I felt myself lifted out on to a pile
      of nets.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV&mdash;THE TRUTH ABOUT HER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>har, lad, lie
      still. Yow&rsquo;ll be &rsquo;ome direc&rsquo;ly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gray-bearded man at the tiller smiled to me in a friendly manner. He
      didn&rsquo;t seem at all excited, but took all that had happened stoically, as
      part of the day&rsquo;s work. Seeing me gaze round questioningly, he added, &ldquo;The
      lassie&rsquo;s well enough, Mr. Cardover. She&rsquo;ll come round. A mouthful o&rsquo; salt
      water won&rsquo;t &rsquo;urt &rsquo;er.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wondered vaguely how he knew my name. Then, as my brain cleared, I
      remembered him as one of the fishermen who called in at my grandmother&rsquo;s
      shop for an occasional chat, seated on a barrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      I raised myself on my elbow. We were rounding the pier-head, running into
      the harbor. I was in a little shrimping-boat. The nets hung out over the
      stern. The old man at the tiller was in oilskins and a younger man was
      shortening sail.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt sick, and giddy, and stiff. A tarpaulin was thrown over me. I tried
      to recollect how I came there. Then I saw Vi lying near me in the bows. A
      sailor&rsquo;s coat was wrapped about her. Her hair lay piled in a golden heap
      over her white throat and breast. Her eyes were closed. The blueness of
      the veins about her temples enhanced her pallor. I made an effort to crawl
      towards her; but the motion of the boat and my own weakness sent me
      sprawling.
    </p>
    <p>
      People from the pier-head had seen us. As we stole up the harbor,
      questions were shouted to the man at the tiller and answers shouted back.
      When we drew in at the quayside an excited crowd had gathered. To every
      newcomer the account was given of how Joe Tuttle, as &rsquo;e war
      a-beat-ing up to the &rsquo;arbor, comed across them two a-driftin&rsquo; off
      the nor&rsquo; beach, &rsquo;alf a mile or so from land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coats were torn off and folded round us. Someone was sent ahead to warn
      neighbor Cardover of what she must expect. Vi was tenderly lifted out and
      carried down the road in the arms of Joe Tuttle. I was hoisted like a sack
      across the shoulders of our younger rescuer. Accompanying us was a
      shouting, jabbering, eager crowd, anxious to tell everyone we passed what
      had happened. My most distinct recollection is the shame I felt of the
      bareness of my dangling legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tramp of heavy feet invaded the shop. I heard the capable voice of
      Grandmother Cardover getting rid of sightseers. &ldquo;Now then, my good people,
      there&rsquo;s nothing &rsquo;ere for you. Out you go; you&rsquo;re not wanted in my
      shop. Thank goodness, we can worry along without your &rsquo;elp.&rdquo; Then I
      heard her in a lower voice giving directions for us to be carried
      upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hot blankets, brought from the bake-house oven, were soon about me and I
      was tucked safe in bed. I have a faint recollection of the doctor coming
      and of hot spirits being forced down my throat. Then they left me alone
      and I fell into the deep sleep of utter weariness.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I awoke, the room was in darkness and a fire was burning. I felt lazy
      and comfortable. I turned on my side and found that I was alone. I began
      to think back. The thought that filled my mind seemed a continuation of
      what I had been dreaming. I was in the trough of a wave, the sea was
      washing over me, Vi&rsquo;s arm was heavy about my neck, and her lips were
      kissing my shoulder. I looked round; her eyes shone into mine, and her
      hair swayed loose about her like the hair of a mermaiden. I listened.
      There were footsteps on the stair. The door opened and my grandmother
      tiptoed to the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I raised myself up. The torpor cleared from my brain. Before the question
      could frame itself, my grandmother had answered it. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s all right,
      Dante; she&rsquo;s in the spare bedroom and sleeping soundly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seated herself beside me and slipped her wrinkled old hand into mine
      beneath the bed-clothes. She sat in silence for some minutes. The light
      from the street-lamp shining in at the window, fell upon her. I could see
      her gray curls wabbling, the way they always did when she was agitated. At
      last she spoke. &ldquo;How did it &rsquo;appen, Dante?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you knowed &rsquo;er before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little by little I gave her all the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A nice young rascal you are,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and a pretty way you&rsquo;ve got o&rsquo;
      love-making. You beat your own father, that you do. And what&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; She laughed till the tears ran down her face. &ldquo;And I
      suppose you think you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to marry &rsquo;er?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the sooner the better I say. Judging by her looks, you might &rsquo;ave
      chose worse. When it comes to wimmen, the Evrards and the Cardovers are
      mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went downstairs to get me some supper. I had given her Vi&rsquo;s address,
      that she might send off a message to Vi&rsquo;s landlady. Poor little Dorrie
      must be beside herself by now, wondering what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I ate my supper, my grandmother kept referring to what I had told
      her. She was very proud and happy. Her eyes twinkled behind her
      spectacles. I had added an entirely original chapter to the history of our
      family&rsquo;s romance. &ldquo;I keep wishin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that your dear ma &lsquo;ad been
      alive. It would just &lsquo;a&rsquo; suited her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The morning broke bright and sunny. I insisted on getting up to breakfast.
      I was a trifle stiff, but apart from that none the worse for my
      experience. It was odd to think that Vi was sleeping in the same house&mdash;Vi,
      who had passed me in the streets without seeing me, Vi from whom I had
      hidden myself, Vi who at this time yesterday morning had seemed so utterly
      unattainable. The sense of her nearness filled me with wild enthusiasm. I
      hummed and whistled while I dressed. I wondered how long she would make me
      wait before we were married. She was mine already. Why should we wait? I
      was impatient to go to her, I could feel the close embrace of her long
      white arm about my neck. I was quite incurious as to who she was or where
      she came from. Life for me began when I met her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I passed her door I halted, listening. I could hear my grandmother
      talking inside, but in such a low voice that I could catch nothing of what
      was said. She was bustling about, beating up the pillows and, as I judged,
      making Vi tidy. Hearing her coming towards the door, I hurried down the
      stairs. The stairs entered into the keeping-room. When she came down, she
      carried an empty breakfast-tray in her hand. I noticed that she had on her
      Sunday best: a black satin dress, a white lace apron trimmed with black
      ribbon, and her finest lace cap spangled with jet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been askin&rsquo; for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I jumped up from my chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she won&rsquo;t see you until you&rsquo;ve breakfasted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While I hastened through the meal, my grandmother chattered gaily. She
      quite approved my choice of a wife and had drawn from Vi one fact, of
      which I was unaware&mdash;that she was an American. She was burning with
      curiosity to learn more about her and was full of the most rosy
      conjectures. She was quite sure that Vi was an heiress&mdash;all American
      women who traveled alone were.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went up to see that all was ready; then she came to the top of the
      stairs and beckoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to leave you alone,&rdquo; she whispered, taking my face between her
      hands. &ldquo;God bless you, my boy.&rdquo; Then she vanished all a-blush and
      a-tremble into the keeping-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blood was surging in my brain. I felt weak from too much happiness.
      Opening the door slowly, I entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I scarcely dared look up at first. The room swam before me. The
      old-fashioned green and red flowers in the carpet ran together. I raised
      my eyes to the large four-poster mahogany bed&mdash;it seemed too large to
      hold such a little person. I could see the outline of her figure, but the
      heavy crimson curtains, hanging from the tester, hid her face from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vi, darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat up, with her hands pressed against her throat. The sunlight,
      shining in at the window, poured down upon her, burnishing her two long
      plaited ropes of hair. She turned towards me; her eyes were misty, her
      bosom swelling. She seemed to be calling me to her, and yet pushing me
      back. I felt my knees breaking under me, and the sob beginning in my
      throat. I ran towards her and knelt down at the bedside, placing my arms
      about her and drawing her to me. For an instant she resisted, then her
      body relaxed. I looked, up at her, pouring out broken sentences. I felt
      that the tears were coming through excess of gladness and bowed my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was bending over me, so near she stooped that her breath was in my
      hair. The sweet warmth of her was all about me. Her lips touched my
      forehead. I held her more closely, but I would not meet her eyes. I dared
      not till my question was answered. The silence between us stretched into
      an eternity. Her hands wandered over me caressingly; it seemed a child
      comforting a man. &ldquo;Poor boy,&rdquo; she whispered over and over, &ldquo;God knows,
      neither of us meant it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I lifted my face to hers, the tenderness in her expression was wiped
      out by a look of wild despair. She tore my hands from about her body and
      tumbled her head back into the pillows with her face turned from me,
      shaken by a storm of sobbing. Muttered exclamations rose to her lips&mdash;things
      and names were mentioned which I only half heard, the purport of which I
      could not understand. I tried to gather her to me, but she broke away from
      me. &ldquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she sobbed, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t touch me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With her loss of self-control my strength returned. I sat beside her on
      the bed, stroking her hand and trying to console her&mdash;trying to tell
      myself that this was quite natural and that everything was well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually she exhausted herself and lay still. &ldquo;You&rsquo; ought to go,&rdquo; she
      whispered; but when I rose to steal away, her hand clutched mine and drew
      me back. In a slow, weary voice she began to speak to me. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do what
      you ask me; I&rsquo;m already married. I thought you would have guessed from
      Dorrie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused to see what I would say or do. When I said nothing, but clasped
      her hand more firmly, she turned her face towards me, gazing up at me from
      the pillow. &ldquo;I thought you would have left me after that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      all my fault; I saw how things were going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest, you did your best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did my best and hurt you. When I told you that I was done
      yesterday, why didn&rsquo;t you let me go? It would all have been so much
      easier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I wanted you,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and still want you.&rdquo; The silence was so
      deep that I could hear the rustle of the sheets at each intake of her
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was so small that it only just came to me. &ldquo;I belong to Dorrie&rsquo;s
      father. He&rsquo;s a good man and he trusts me, though he knows I don&rsquo;t love
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat up, letting go my hand. I propped the pillows under her. She
      signed to me to seat myself further away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is mine. She is mine,&rdquo; I kept thinking to myself. &ldquo;We belong to one
      another whatever she says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be better soon,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;then I can go away. You must try to
      forget that you ever knew me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can never forget. I shall wait for you.&rdquo; Then the old treacherous
      argument came to me, though it was sincerely spoken. &ldquo;Why need we go out
      of one another&rsquo;s lives? Vi dearest, can&rsquo;t we be friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated. &ldquo;I was thinking of <i>you</i> when I said it. For me it
      would be easier; I have Dorrie to live for. It would be more difficult for
      you&mdash;you are a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you trust me, Vi? You told me that he trusted you just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was thin and tired. &ldquo;Could we ever be only friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must try&mdash;we can pretend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But such trials all have one ending.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ours won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her will was broken and her desire urged it. She held out her hand. &ldquo;Then
      let&rsquo;s be friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took it in mine and kissed it. Even then, I believe, we doubted our
      strength.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V&mdash;LUCK TURNS IN MY FAVOR
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he <i>Ransby
      Chronicle</i> had a full account of the averted bathing fatality. In a
      small world of town gossip it was a sensation almost as important as a
      local murder. Columns were filled up with what Vi&rsquo;s landlady said, and Joe
      Tuttle, and Mrs. Cardover, and even Dorrie. They tried to interview me
      without success; they couldn&rsquo;t interview Vi, for she was in bed. From the
      landlady they gleaned some facts of which I was ignorant. Vi was Mrs.
      Violet Carpenter, of Sheba, Massachusetts. Her husband was the owner of
      large New England cotton factories. She had been away from America upwards
      of a year, traveling in Europe. She expected to return home in a month.
      The history of my parentage was duly recorded, including an account of my
      father&rsquo;s elopement. All the old scandal concerning my mother was raked up
      and re-garnished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing what my intentions had been toward Vi, my grandmother was terribly
      flustered at the discovery that Vi was a married woman. She was hurt in
      her pride; she wanted to blame somebody. Her sense of the proprieties was
      offended, and she felt that her reputation was secretly tarnished. An
      immoral situation was existing under her roof&mdash;at least, that was
      what she felt. She wanted to get rid of Vi directly, but the doctor
      forbade her to be moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to think I should &rsquo;ave come to this!&rdquo; she kept exclaiming,
      &ldquo;after livin&rsquo; all these years honored and respected in my little town!
      Mind, I don&rsquo;t blame you, and I don&rsquo;t blame &rsquo;er. Poor things! You
      couldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;elp it. But I can&rsquo;t get over it&mdash;there was you
      a-proposin&rsquo; in my spare bedroom to a married woman, and she a-lyin&rsquo; in
      bed! What would folks say if they was to &rsquo;ear about it? And in my
      &rsquo;ouse! And me so honored and respected!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her horror seemed to center in the fact that it should have happened in
      the spare bedroom of all places, where all her dead had been laid out.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took it for granted that Vi and I would part forever, as soon as she
      was well enough to travel. &ldquo;By all showings, it&rsquo;s &rsquo;igh time she
      went back to &rsquo;er &rsquo;usband,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She suffered another shock when I undeceived her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re playin&rsquo; with
      fire, Dante; that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re doin&rsquo;. Take the word of an old woman who
      knows the world&mdash;friendship will drift into familiarity and, more&rsquo;n
      likely, familiarity &rsquo;ll drift into something else. A Cardover&rsquo;s bad
      enough where wimmen is concerned, but an Evrard&rsquo;s the devil. It&rsquo;s the
      gipsy blood that makes &rsquo;em mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned a deaf ear to all her protests. Vi and I had done nothing wicked,
      and we weren&rsquo;t going to run away from one another as though we had. A
      mistake had occurred which concerned only ourselves; we had nothing to be
      ashamed of. Then my grandmother threatened to send for Ruthita so that, at
      least, we might not be alone together. I was quick to see that Ruthita&rsquo;s
      presence would be a protection, so agreed that she should be invited down
      to Ransby provided she was told nothing. Meanwhile no meetings between Vi
      and myself were allowed. My grandmother guarded the spare bedroom like a
      dragon.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in a timid way, in her heart of hearts, she was proud of the
      complication. It intrigued her. It made us all interesting persons. She
      wore the indignant face of a Mother Grundy because she knew that society
      would expect it of her; in many little sympathetic ways she revealed her
      truer self. She would take her knitting up to Vi&rsquo;s bedside&mdash;Mrs.
      Carpenter as she insisted on calling her&mdash;and would spend long hours
      there. When conversing with me in the keeping-room late at night, she
      would grow reminiscent and tell brave stories of the rewards which came at
      length to thwarted lovers. I learnt from her that Mr. Randall Carpenter
      was much older than either Vi or myself. If he were to die&mdash;&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second morning that Vi had been in the house I returned from a
      desultory walk to find my grandmother in close conference with a stranger.
      He was a dapper, perky little man, white-haired, bald-headed, whiskered,
      with darting birdlike manners and a dignified air of precision about him.
      He had the well-dressed appearance of a city gentleman rather than of a
      Ransbyite. He wore a frock-coat, top-hat, gray trousers, shiny boots, and
      white spats. I judged that he belonged to a profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apologizing for my intrusion, I crossed the keeping-room, and was on the
      point of mounting the stairs when the little man rose, all smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your grandson, Mrs. Cardover, I presume? He&rsquo;s more of an Evrard than a
      Cardover&mdash;all except his mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was introduced to me as Mr. Seagirt, the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy to know you, Mr. Cardover. Happy to know you, sir.&rdquo; He pulled off
      his gloves and shook hands in a gravely formal manner. &ldquo;We shall see more
      of one another as time goes on. I hope it most sincerely. In fact, I may
      say, from the way things are going, there is little doubt of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We all sat down. There was a strange constrained atmosphere of excitement
      and embarrassment about both Mr. Seagirt and my grandmother. They balanced
      on the edge of their chairs, flickering their eyelids and twiddling their
      thumbs. Lawyer Seagirt kept up a hurried flow of procrastinating
      conversation, continually limiting or overemphasizing his statements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard of what you did a day or two ago, Mr. Cardover&mdash;we have
      all heard of it. You have created an excellent impression&mdash;most
      excellent. The papers have been very flattering, but not more so than you
      deserve. Ransby feels quite proud of you. Though you are a Londoner, you
      belong to Ransby&mdash;no getting away from that. I suppose you&rsquo;d tell us
      that you belong to Oxford. Ah, well, it&rsquo;s natural&mdash;but we claim you
      first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the time he had been talking he and my grandmother had been signaling
      to one another with their eyes, as though one were saying, &ldquo;You tell him,&rdquo;
       and the other, &ldquo;No, you tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they did make up their minds to take me inta their secret, they did
      it both together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your grandfather&mdash;Sir Charles Evrard,&rdquo; they began, and there they
      stuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last it came out that my grandfather had expressed a wish to see me,
      and had sent Lawyer Seagirt to make the necessary inquiries about me. This
      action on his part could have but one meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later I was invited over to Woadley Hall to spend a week there.
      Before I went, I had an interview with Vi, in my grandmother&rsquo;s presence.
      She promised me that she would not leave Ransby until after I returned. My
      fear had been that some spasm of caution might make her seize this
      opportunity to return to America.
    </p>
    <p>
      I drove out to Woadley Hall late in the afternoon, planning to get there
      in time for dinner. I felt considerably nervous. I had been brought up in
      dread of Sir Charles since childhood. I did not know what kind of conduct
      was expected from me or what kind of reception I might expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we swung in through the iron gates and passed up the long avenue of
      chestnuts and elms which led through the parkland to the house, my
      nervousness increased into childish consternation. The pride of ancestry
      and the comfortable signs of wealth filled me with distress. I belonged to
      this, and was on my way to be examined to see whether I could prove
      worthy. I was not ashamed of my father&rsquo;s family, but I was prepared to be
      angry if anyone else should show shame of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far away, on the edge of the green grassland, just where the woods began
      to cast their shadow, I could see dappled fallow-deer grazing. Colts,
      hearing us approaching, lifted up their heads and stared, then whisking
      their tails galloped off to watch us from behind their dams. Turrets and
      broken gables of the old Jacobean Hall rose out of the trees before us.
      Rooks were coming home to their nests in the tall elms, cawing. The
      home-farm lay over to our left; the herd was coming out from the milking,
      jingling their bells. A streak of orange lay across the blue of the west&mdash;the
      beginning of the sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately on my arrival, I was shown to my bedroom to dress. I began to
      have the sense of &ldquo;belonging.&rdquo; The windows looked out on a sunken garden,
      all ablaze with stocks, snap-dragon, sweet-william, and all manner of
      old-world flowers. In the scented stillness I could hear the splash of a
      fountain playing in the center. Beyond that were other gardens, Dutch and
      Italian, divided by red walls and terraces. Beyond them all, through the
      shadowed trees one caught glimpses of a lake, with swans and gaily-painted
      water-fowl sailing like toy-yachts upon its surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the servant had left me, I commenced to dress leisurely. After that I
      sat down, waiting for the gong to sound. I wondered if this was the room
      where my mother had slept. How much my father&rsquo;s love must have meant to
      her that she should have sacrificed so much prosperous certainty to share
      his insecure fortunes. Yet, as I looked back, it was a smiling face that I
      remembered, with no marks of misgiving or regret upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not meet my grandfather until the meal was about to be served. I
      think he had planned our first encounter carefully, so that our conduct
      might be restrained by the presence of servants. His greeting was that of
      any host to any guest. Our conversation at dinner was on impersonal,
      intellectual topics&mdash;the kind that is carried on between well-bred
      persons who are thrown together for the moment and are compelled to be
      polite to one another. The only way in which he betrayed nervousness was
      by crumbling his bread with his left hand while he was conversing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding that I was not anxious to force matters, he became more at his
      ease. He addressed me as Mr. Cardover, with stiff and kindly courtesy. We
      took our cigars out on to the terrace to watch the last of the sunset. He
      was talking of Oxford, and the changes which had taken place in the
      University since he was an undergraduate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you are a Fellow of Lazarus, Mr. Cardover?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a nephew there a few years ago, Lord Halloway, the son of my poor
      brother-in-law, the Earl of Lovegrove. You may know him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only by hearsay. He was before my time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My grandfather knocked the ash from his cigar. Then, speaking in a low
      voice, very deliberately, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you have heard nothing good about
      him. He has not turned out well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused: I felt that I was being tested. When I kept silent, he
      continued, &ldquo;I have no son. He was to have followed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shortly afterwards he excused himself, saying that he was an old man and
      retired early to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For six days we maintained our polite and measured interchange of
      courtesies. I was left free most of the time to entertain myself. He was a
      perfect host, and knew exactly how far to share my company without
      appearing-niggardly of his companionship or, on the other hand, intruding
      it on me to such an extent that we wore out our common fund of interests.
      For myself, I wished that I might see more of him. Never by any direct
      statement did he own that there was any relationship between us. Yet
      gradually he began to imply his intention in having me to visit him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would have been completely happy, had it not been that Vi was absent. I
      reckoned up the hours until I should return. All day my imagination was
      following her movements. I refused to look ahead to the certainty of
      approaching separation&mdash;it was enough for me that I could&rsquo; be near
      her in the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was strange how poignant the world had become, how subtly, swiftly
      suggestive, since I had discovered her presence in it. All my sensations,
      even those outwardly unrelated to her, grouped themselves into a memory of
      her sweetness. It was a blind and pagan love she had aroused&mdash;one
      which recognized no standards, but craved only fulfilment.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were times when I stood back appalled, as a man who comes suddenly
      to the edge of a precipice, when I realized where this love was leading.
      Then my awakened conscience would remind me of my promise&mdash;that we
      would be only friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the thoughts which now made me glad, now sorrowful, as I rode
      through the leafy lanes round Woadley at the side of my proud old
      grandfather. I would steal guilty glances at him, marveling that no rumor
      of what I was thinking had come to him by some secret process of
      telepathy. He looked so cold and unimpassioned, I wondered if he had ever
      loved a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to love the Woadley country with the love which only comes from
      ownership. The white Jacobean Hall, with the chestnuts and elm-trees
      grouped about it and the doves fluttering above its gables, became the
      starting point for all the future chapters of my romance. I began to see
      life in its prosperous, substantial aspect. The stately dignity of my
      environment had its subconscious effect upon my lawless turbulence. In the
      morning I would wake with the rooks cawing and, going to the window, would
      look out on the sunken garden, the peaches ripening against the walls, the
      dew sparkling on the trim box-hedges, and the leaves beating the air like
      wings of anchored butterflies as the wind from the sea stirred them.
      Everywhere the discipline of history was apparent&mdash;the accumulated,
      ordered effort of generations of men and women dead and gone. I had been
      accustomed to regard myself as an isolated unit, responsible to myself
      alone for my actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last evening on entering my bedroom, I noticed that there had been a
      change in the ornaments on my dressing-table. A gold-framed miniature had
      been placed in the middle of the table, face up, before the mirror. It was
      a delicate, costly piece of work done on ivory. I held it to the light to
      examine it, wondering how it had come there.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must have been taken in the heyday of my mother&rsquo;s girlhood, when all
      the county bachelors were courting her. The gray eyes looked out on me
      with bewitching frankness. The red lips were parted as if on the point of
      widening into laughter. The long white neck held the head poised at an
      angle half-arch, half-haughty. As I gazed on it, I saw that the similarity
      between our features was extraordinary. It was my grandfather&rsquo;s way of
      expressing to me the tenderness that he could not bring himself to utter.
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast next morning, he led the way into the library. He looked
      graver and more unapproachable than ever. &ldquo;Mr. Cardover, your visit has
      been a great pleasure to me. Mr. Seagirt will be here before you leave.
      Before he comes I wish to say that I want no thanks for what I am doing.
      It is more or less a business matter. All your life there have been
      strained relations between myself and your father, which it is impossible
      for any of us to overlook or forget. So far as you are concerned, you owe
      him your loyalty. I do not propose to bring about unhappiness between a
      father and a son by encouraging your friendship further. This week was a
      necessary exception; I could not take the step I have now decided on
      without knowing something about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He cleared his throat and rose from his chair, as if afraid that I might
      lay hold of him. He walked up and down the library, with his head bowed
      and his right hand held palm out towards me in a gesture that asked for
      silence. He halted by the big French window, on the blind before which
      years ago I had watched his shadow fall. He stood with his back towards
      me, looking down the avenue. Then he turned again to me. The momentary
      emotion which had interrupted him had vanished. His voice was more cold
      and polite than ever. Only the twitching of the muscles about his eyes
      betrayed the storm of feeling that stirred him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In any case,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you would have inherited my baronetcy. Perhaps,
      you did not know that. I could not alienate that from you. The patent
      under which it is held allows it to pass, for one generation, through the
      female line to the next male holder. Until recently my will was made in
      the favor of my nephew, Lord Halloway. Circumstances have arisen which
      lead me to believe that such a disposal of my estate would be unwise. We
      Evrards have had our share of frailties, but we have always been noted as
      clean men. Something that I saw about you in the papers brought your name
      before my notice. I made up my mind then and there that, if you proved all
      that I hoped for, I would make you my successor. As I have said, this is a
      business transaction, in return for which I neither expect nor wish any
      display of gratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While we had been speaking I had heard the trot of a horse approaching.
      Just as he finished Mr. Seagirt entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Seagirt,&rdquo; said Sir Charles, &ldquo;I have explained the situation to Mr.
      Cardover. Any communications he or I have to make to one another relative
      to the estate, we will make through you. If you have brought the will, I
      will sign it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was fingering his pen, when I startled him by speaking. &ldquo;Sir Charles,
      you have spoken of not encouraging my friendship. I am a grown man and of
      an age to choose my own friendships where I like, and this without offense
      to my father. I have another loyalty, to my dead mother&mdash;a loyalty
      which you share. If you care to trust me, I should like to be your
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took my hand in his and for one small moment let his left hand rest
      lightly on my shoulder. We gazed frankly into one another&rsquo;s eyes without
      pretense or disguise. Then the shame of revealing his true feelings
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see. We shall see,&rdquo; he muttered hastily; &ldquo;I am an old man.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER VI&mdash;MOTHS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> week had worked
      wonders with Grandmother Cardover. She had fallen a victim to Vi&rsquo;s charm
      and, in that strange way that old folks have, had warmed her age at the
      fire of Vi&rsquo;s youth. There was an unmistakable change in her; the
      somberness of her dress was lightened here and there with a dash of
      colored ribbons. As long as I could remember, the only ornaments she had
      permitted herself were of black jet, as befitted her widowed state. But
      now the woman&rsquo;s instinct for self-decoration had come to life. Vi&rsquo;s
      exquisite femininity had made her remember that she herself was a woman.
      She had rummaged through her jewelry and found a large gold-set cameo
      brooch, which she wore at her throat, and some rings, and a long gold
      chain, which she now wore about her neck, from which her watch was
      suspended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vi&rsquo;s vivid physical beauty and intense joy in life had broadened the
      horizons of everyone in the house, and set them dreaming. Ruthita, coming
      down from London, had at once become infatuated. From day to day she had
      prolonged Vi&rsquo;s visit, now with one excuse, now another. They had brought
      Dorrie down to stay with Vi at the shop&mdash;little Bee&rsquo;s Knee as my
      Grannie called her, because she was so tiny and a bee&rsquo;s knee was the
      smallest thing she could think of with which to compare her. It was many
      years since a child&rsquo;s prattle had been heard about that quiet house. Vi&rsquo;s
      comradeship with her little daughter finished the persuading of my
      grandmother that she was safe and good. All virtuous women believe in the
      virtue of a woman who is fond of children.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were sitting down to lunch in the keeping-room when I entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, if it isn&rsquo;t Dante!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The greeting I received was in welcome contrast to the cold, guarded
      reserve of the past seven days. A place was made for me at table between
      my grandmother and Ruthita. It was a gay little party that waited,
      watching me curiously across the dishes and plates, to hear my news. Just
      then I preferred the cosiness of my grandmother&rsquo;s shop to the chilly
      dignity of Woadley Hall. Outside the sunshine slanted across the
      courtyard, leaving one half in shadow, the other golden white. The maid,
      coming in and out from the kitchen in her rustling print-dress, with her
      smiling country face, was a pleasanter sight than the butler at Woadley.
      From the shop came the smell of tar and rope and new-made bread.
      Everything was so frank and kindly, and unashamed of itself. Here in the
      keeping-room of the ship-chandler&rsquo;s shop we were humanly intimate&mdash;&ldquo;coxy-loxy&rdquo;
       as my grandmother would have expressed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told a sorrowful tale at first, which seemed to foreshadow a sorrowful
      ending. I spoke of the stiff formality of my reception, the garnished
      gentility which had marked my intercourse with Sir Charles, the withheld
      confidence&mdash;the fact that my mother&rsquo;s name was scarcely mentioned.
      Ruthita&rsquo;s hand sought mine beneath the table; I could feel the fingers
      tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;he called me into his study. He told me that I
      must leave within the hour and that our friendship could go no further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old rascal!&rdquo; exclaimed Grandmother Cardover, bringing down her knife
      and fork on her plate with a clatter. &ldquo;What was he a-doin&rsquo;, gettin&rsquo; you
      there to Woadley? He must &lsquo;a&rsquo; known what we all expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I tilted back my chair, putting on an expression of long-suffering
      melancholy. &ldquo;He wanted to see what I was like, I suppose. His chief reason
      was that he wanted to make a new will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babel broke loose. Why hadn&rsquo;t I told them earlier? Why had I harrowed up
      their feelings for nothing? What were the particulars? I was cruel to have
      kept them in suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandmother Cardover was hysterical with joy. She wanted to run out into
      the streets and tell everybody. She began with the maid in the kitchen,
      and would have gone on to the men in the bake-house if I hadn&rsquo;t stopped
      her by appealing to her curiosity, saying there was more to tell. As for
      Ruthita, she just put her arms about me and laid her head on my shoulder,
      crying for sheer gladness. Little Bee&rsquo;s Knee looked on open-mouthed,
      shocked that grownups should behave so foolishly. Vi gazed at me with a
      far-away stare in her eyes, picturing the might-have-beens, and I gazed
      back at her across the gulf that widened between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Discretion was thrown to the wind. When Vi gathered Dorrie to her and
      began to excuse herself, she was told that she must stay and make one of
      the family. Then the story was told again with the new perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
      With shame and self-reproach I look back and perceive how carelessly I
      accepted all Ruthita&rsquo;s admiration. My new good fortune promised nothing
      for her; yet she could rejoice in it. In her shy girl&rsquo;s world, had I known
      it, I figured as something between a faery-prince and a hero. Through me
      she looked out into a more generous world of glamour than any she had
      personally experienced.. Poor little Ruthita, with her mouse-like
      timidity! She had lived all her days in a walled-in garden, treading the
      dull monotonous round of self-sacrificing duties. No one ever credited her
      with a career of her own. No one stopped to think that she might have
      dreams and a will of her own. They told her what to do and let their
      gratitude be taken for granted. She humored my father when he was
      discouraged, did the housekeeping, and took shelter behind the superior
      social grace of the Snow Lady. We all loved her, but we made the mistake
      of not telling her&mdash;we supposed she knew. All the strong things that
      men and women do together, all love&rsquo;s comedy and tragedy, were so much
      hearsay to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon and evening she sat beside me holding my hand with frank
      affection, making me feel that in loving Vi I was stealing something that
      belonged to her. More than that, I was feeling for this woman, who had
      been nothing to me a few weeks ago, a quality of kindness and
      consideration that I had always withheld from the child-friend who had
      tiptoed her way up to womanhood beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      After tea we mounted to the drawing-room, which was over the shop and
      faced the street. It was usually occupied only on Sundays and feast-days,
      or when a visiting Methodist minister had been apportioned to my
      grandmother for entertainment. Faded engravings of sacred subjects and
      simpering females elaborately framed, hung upon the walls. On the
      mantelshelf stood some quaint specimens of Ransby china&mdash;red-roofed
      cottages with grapes ripening above the porch, and a lover coming up the
      path while his lady watched him from the window. The chairs were
      upholstered in woolwork on canvas, which my grandmother had done in her
      youth. In one corner stood a heavy rosewood piano on which all the family
      portraits were arranged. In this room comfort was sacrificed to appearance&mdash;the
      furniture was sedate rather than genial. Nothing was haphazard or awry.
      The mats and antimacassars never budged an inch from their places. No
      smell of beer, or cheese, or baking bread vulgarized the sacred
      respectability of its atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, as we sat together talking, the light began to fade. Heavy footsteps
      of sailors in their sea-boots, passing down the street from the harbor to
      the cottages, only emphasized the quiet. We watched the sky grow pink
      behind the masts of shipping, then green, then gray. Cordage and rigging
      were etched distinctly against the gloom of the oncoming night. At the top
      of the street a light sprang up, then another, then another. The
      lamp-lighter with his long pole and ladder passed by. Now with the heavy
      tread of men&rsquo;s feet the tip-a-tap of girls&rsquo; footsteps began to mingle.
      Sometimes a snatch of laughter would reach us; then, as if afraid of the
      sound it made, it died abruptly away. While we talked in subdued voices,
      it seemed to me that all the sailor-lovers with their lassies had
      conspired to steal by the house that night. I fell to wondering what it
      felt like to slip your arm about the waist of a woman you loved, feel her
      warmth and trust and nearness, feel her head droop back against your
      shoulder, see her face flash up in the starlight and know that, while your
      lips were trembling against hers, she was abandoning herself soul and body
      to you in the summer dusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorrie had crept into her mother&rsquo;s lap. Her soft breathing told that she
      was sleeping. One small hand, with fingers crumpled, rested against her
      mother&rsquo;s throat. Someone had called to see Grandmother Cardover, so Vi,
      Ruth-ita, and I were left alone together. Sitting back in our chairs out
      of reach of the street-lamp, we could not see the expression on one
      another&rsquo;s faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would give all the world to be you, Mrs. Carpenter,&rdquo; Ruthita whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be me! Why? I sometimes get very tired of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were you I should have Dorrie. It must be very sweet to be a mother.
      Why is it that she always calls you Vi and never mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She picked that up from her father. I never corrected her because&mdash;well,
      because somehow I like it. It makes me seem younger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to <i>seem</i> young,&rdquo; I interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old do you think I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the same age as myself and Ruthita.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed. &ldquo;That couldn&rsquo;t be; Dorrie is eight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I give up guessing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m twenty-seven. I was little more than a child, you see, when I
      married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother married early,&rdquo; said Ruthita, &ldquo;and my papa was only twenty at the
      time. She says that early marriages turn out happiest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vi made no answer. The silence grew awkward. We could almost hear one
      another&rsquo;s thoughts trying to hide. Why had she explained in that tone of
      half-apology, &ldquo;I was little more than a child; you see, when I married.&rdquo;
       Why didn&rsquo;t she say something now? Was it because an early marriage had
      proved for her disastrous? Then, if it had, what moral obligation
      separated us? Who was this husband who could dispense with her for a year,
      and yet had the power to stretch out his arm across the Atlantic and
      thrust me aside?
    </p>
    <p>
      She leant forward. The light from the street-lamp kindled her face and
      smoldered in her hair. She had the wistful, rapt expression of a young
      girl, ignorant as yet of the bitter-sweet of love, who dreams of an ideal
      lover. I felt then that her soul was virgin; it had never been a man&rsquo;s
      possession. It was almost mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruthita&rsquo;s remark about the happiness of early marriages was forgotten,
      when Vi returned to the subject. &ldquo;They may be sometimes,&rdquo; she said,
      speaking doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught my eye resting on her. Conscious that her qualification had
      divulged a secret, she hurried into an implied defense of her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a letter from Mr. Carpenter this morning. He&rsquo;s lonely. He says he
      can&rsquo;t bear to be without me any longer. He wants me to return home at
      once. He&rsquo;s not seen Dorrie for nearly a year. He&rsquo;s afraid she&rsquo;ll forget
      him entirely. If I don&rsquo;t go to him, he says he&rsquo;ll come and fetch me. It&rsquo;s
      been horrid of me to stay away so long. When we left, we only intended to
      be gone for three months. Somehow the time lengthened. I wanted to see so
      much. He&rsquo;s been too easy with me. He&rsquo;s been awfully kind. He always has
      been kind. He treats me like a spoilt child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had been speaking so eagerly and hurriedly that she had not heard the
      creaking of the stairs. Through the darkness I could see my grandmother
      standing in the doorway. Vi turned to Ruthita with a pretense of gaiety,
      &ldquo;No wonder you English don&rsquo;t understand us. Don&rsquo;t you think that American
      husbands are very patient?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I do,&rdquo; said Ruthita. &ldquo;What makes them so different from English
      husbands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They love their wives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to tell from the bantering tone in Vi&rsquo;s voice, whether
      she spoke the last words in cynicism or sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandmother Cardover took her literally. Her national pride was touched.
      She believed that an aspersion had been cast on the affection of all
      married Englishmen. She advanced into the room with suspicions aroused,
      bristling with morality. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s what they call love in America,&rdquo; she
      snorted, &ldquo;then it&rsquo;s glad I am that I was born in Ransby. &lsquo;They shall be
      one flesh&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s what the Holy Book says about marriage. And &rsquo;ow
      can you be one flesh if you stay away from one another a twelvemonth at a
      time? Why, when my Will&rsquo;am was alive, I never slept a night away from &rsquo;im,
      from the day we was married to the day he died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The darkness about her seemed to quiver with indignation. I could see her
      gray curls bobbing, and hear the keys hanging from her waist jangle, as
      she trembled. Ruthita cowered close to me, shocked and frightened. Dorrie
      woke and began to whimper to be taken to bed. We all waited for a natural
      expression of anger from Vi.
    </p>
    <p>
      She set Dorrie on to her feet very gently, whispering to her mothering
      words, telling her not to cry. Drawing herself up, she faced into the
      darkness. When she spoke there was a sweet, low pleading in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Cardover, you took me too seriously. I&rsquo;m sorry. You misunderstood
      me. I believe all that you have said&mdash;a wife ought to be her
      husband&rsquo;s companion. There have been reasons for my long absence, which I
      cannot explain; if I did, you might not understand them. But I want <i>you</i>
      always to believe well of me. I have never had such kindness from any
      woman as you have given me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I heard my Grannie sniffle. Vi must have heard Her, She left Dorrie and,
      running across the room, put her arms about her. I heard them blaming
      themselves, and taking everything back, the way women do when they ask
      forgiveness. I lifted Dorrie into my arms, and Ruthita and I tiptoed from
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently they came down to us. Grandmother Cardover was smiling
      comically, as though she was rather pleased at what had happened. Vi said
      that she must be going. Ruthita and I volunteered to accompany her back to
      her lodgings. So the storm in the tea-cup ended, leaving me with new
      materials for conjecture and reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way up the High Street we chatted volubly, trying to overlay what
      had occurred with a new impression. We talked against time and without
      sincerity. When we had reached the black flint house and the door had
      shut, Ruthita snuggled close to me with a relieved little sigh. Ever since
      my return from Woadley she had been waiting for this moment of privacy.
      With a sweet sisterly air of proprietorship she slipped her arm through
      mine. We turned down a score and struck out across the denes to the north
      beach, where we could be quiet. A wet wind from the sea pattered about our
      faces, giving Ruthita an excuse to cling yet more closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      You would not have called Ruthita beautiful in those days. She lacked the
      fire that goes with beauty. She was too humble in her self-esteem, too
      self-effacing. But one who had looked closely would have discerned
      something more lasting than mere physical beauty&mdash;the loveliness of a
      pure spirit looking out from her quiet eyes. She was one of those domestic
      saints, unaware of their own goodness, that one sometimes finds in
      middle-class families; women who are never heard of, who live only through
      their influence on their menfolk&rsquo;s lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her features were small, but perfect. Her figure slight, and buoyant in
      its carriage. Her complexion white, but ready to suffuse with color at the
      least sign of appreciation. Her glory was in her hair, which was black and
      abundant as night. From a child I had always thought that her feet and
      hands were most beautiful in their fragile tininess. I never told her any
      of these flattering observations, which would have meant so much if put
      into words. Brothers don&rsquo;t&mdash;and I was as good as her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; said Ruthita, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s something awfully queer
      about Mrs. Carpenter&rsquo;s marriage? I&rsquo;ve been with her nearly a week now, and
      I&rsquo;ve never heard her mention her husband until to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Dorrie doesn&rsquo;t speak of him either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve noticed that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Ruthita surprised me. &ldquo;Do you know, Dante, I think to marry the wrong
      man must be purgatory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was amused at the note of seriousness in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruthie, to hear you speak one&rsquo;d suppose you&rsquo;d been in love. Have you ever
      thought that you&rsquo;ll have to marry some day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll he have to be like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held her tongue. My jauntiness had made her shy. &ldquo;Come, Ruthie,&rdquo; I
      said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt you. I hate to own that you&rsquo;re grown up. I
      didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d given a thought to marriage. Tell me, what&rsquo;ll he have
      to be like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I halted, swinging her round so she had to look up in my face. She wore a
      hunted look of cornered perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never spoken of these things even to mother,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They all
      treat me as though I were still a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wondered what was her trouble. The searchlight swept her. I saw the
      eagerness for confession on her trembling mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire which her beauty had always lacked leapt up. I was amazed at the
      transformation. She looked reckless. The mask of maidenly tranquillity had
      slipped aside; I saw all the longing of her unnoticed womanhood focused
      for an instant in her eyes. The search-light traveled out to sea again. I
      repeated, &ldquo;What must he be like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She reached up to me, so that her lips almost touched mine. &ldquo;I think he
      must be like you,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all answers that was the last I had expected. I had thought myself on
      the brink of some great discovery&mdash;that she, too, had some secret
      lover. I slipped my arm about her and we strolled on through the darkness
      in silence. Ahead the harbor-lights, reflected across the water, drew
      nearer. We climbed the beach and the sea-wall, and made our way across the
      denes to the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all wrong,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Some day, when you do fall in love, you&rsquo;ll
      get a better standard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We entered the lamp-lit town. For the rest of the evening we did not say
      much. I was thinking how easy it is for two people to live always together
      and yet never to understand each other. Who would have guessed that little
      Ruthita had this hunger to be loved?
    </p>
    <p>
      While we were seated at breakfast next morning, someone walked across the
      shop and tapped on the door of the keeping-room. Before any of us could
      spring up, Lawyer Seagirt entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your seats. Keep your seats,&rdquo; he said cheerily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll
      excuse this early call when you hear what I&rsquo;ve come about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With his back to the empty fireplace, he straddled the hearthrug, bowing
      first to my grandmother, then to Ruthita. Then he settled his gaze on me,
      with the beaming benevolence of a bachelor uncle. He cleared his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahem! Ahem! Mr. Cardover, I congratulate you. After you left yesterday,
      Sir Charles spoke of you with considerable feeling. He expressed
      sentiments concerning you which from him meant much&mdash;much more than
      if uttered by any other man. For many years he has honored me with his
      confidence, yet on no occasion do I remember him to have displayed so much
      emotion. Of course all this is strictly between ourselves and must go no
      further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Like three mandarins we nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my pleasant duty to have to inform you, Mr. Cardover, that Sir
      Charles has been pleased to make you an allowance. It will be paid
      quarterly on the first day of January, April, July, and October, and will
      be delivered to you through my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he halted. Grandmother Cardover, losing patience, forgot her
      manners. &ldquo;God bless my soul,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;how the man maunders! How
      much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Lawyer Seagirt, &ldquo;the amount is four hundred pounds per
      annum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good man had never found himself so popular. He was made to sit down
      to table with us, despite his protests that he had breakfasted already.
      The money might have been coming out of his own pocket for all the fuss we
      made of him. Every now and then the fact of my prosperity would strike
      Grandmother Cardover afresh. Throwing up her hands she would exclaim,
      &ldquo;Four &rsquo;undred pounds, and he&rsquo;s got two &rsquo;undred already from
      his fellowship! It&rsquo;s more than I&rsquo;ve ever earned in any year with all my
      wear and tear. Just you wait till his pa &rsquo;ears about it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That morning I took Ruthita to Norwich. She was puzzled when I told her to
      get ready to come. All the way over in the train she kept trying to guess
      my purpose. The truth was I had contrasted her with Vi. Vi was not only
      exquisite in herself, but as expensively exquisite as fine clothes could
      make her. Ruthita, on the other hand, had the appearance of making the
      most genteel impression at the minimum expenditure of money. My father&rsquo;s
      means were narrow, and she was not his daughter; therefore the Snow Lady
      insisted on making most of her own and Ruthita&rsquo;s dresses. Rigid economies
      had been exercised; stuffs had been turned, and dyed, and made over again.
      Now that I could afford it, I was determined to see what fine feathers
      could do for this shy little sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the gowns came home, even Ruthita was surprised at the prettiness
      that filmy muslins and French laces accentuated in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word, Ruthie, you&rsquo;re a dainty little armful. You won&rsquo;t have to wait
      long for that lover now,&rdquo; I told her, when she came down into the
      keeping-room to show herself to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pouted and made a face at me like a child. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want lovers,&rdquo; she
      laughed. &ldquo;I only want my big brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she had gone upstairs my grandmother turned to me. &ldquo;You can go too
      far with her, Dannie.&rdquo; She only called me Dannie when she was saying
      something serious or a little wounding. &ldquo;You can go too far with her,
      Dannie. I should advise you to be careful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you driving at?&rdquo; I asked bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just this, that however you may pretend to one another, she isn&rsquo;t your
      sister and you aren&rsquo;t her brother. Any day you may wake something up in
      her that you didn&rsquo;t mean to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stuff and nonsense,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;At heart she&rsquo;s only a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I can say is you&rsquo;re going the right way to work to make her a woman,&rdquo;
       my grandmother said shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon I persuaded Ruthita to put on all her finery and come for a
      walk on the esplanade. I wanted her to lose her timidity and to discover
      for herself that she was as good as anybody. I felt a boyish pride in
      walking beside her; she was my creation&mdash;I had dressed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had passed the pier and entered the long trim walk, lined with
      sculptured Neptunes, which runs along the seafront from Ransby to
      Pakewold, when a figure which had a morbid interest for me came in sight.
      It was that of a buxom broad-hipped woman, handsome in her own bold
      fashion, leading by the hand an over-dressed, half-witted child. As she
      drew nearer, the rouge on her face became discernible. She strolled with a
      swagger through the fashionable crowd, eyeing the men with sly effrontery.
      She was known in Ransby by the nickname of &ldquo;Lady Halloway.&rdquo; She was the
      bathing-machine man&rsquo;s daughter, and had been the victim of one of my
      cousin&rsquo;s earliest amorous adventures. It was commonly believed that he was
      the father of her child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the news had got abroad that I had supplanted Halloway in my
      grandfather&rsquo;s favor, she had glowered at me, with undisguised hostility,
      whenever we met.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we passed, Ruthita&rsquo;s parasol just touched her. It was the woman&rsquo;s
      fault, for she had crowded us purposely. I raised my hat, muttering an
      apology, and was on the point of moving forward, when she wrenched the
      parasol from Ruthita&rsquo;s hand and flung it to the ground. Ruthita stared at
      her too surprised to say a word. The woman herself, for the moment, was
      too infuriated to express herself. All the bitterness of a deserted
      mistress, the pent-up resentment against years of contempt and the false
      pride with which she had brazened out her shame among her fellow-townsmen,
      came to the surface and found an excuse for utterance. People nearest to
      us halted in their promenade and, gathering round, began to form the
      nucleus of an audience. An audience for her oratory was what &ldquo;Lady
      Halloway&rdquo; most desired. Her lips were drawn back from her teeth and her
      hands were clenched; anger re-created her into something almost
      magnificent and wholly brutal. When she spoke, she addressed herself to
      Ruthita, but her eyes were fixed on mine in vixenish defiance. The
      over-dressed, top-heavy oddity at her side steadied himself by clinging to
      her skirts, gazing from one to the other of us with a vacant, wondering
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      I picked up Ruthita&rsquo;s parasol and handed it back to her, whispering that
      she should go on. The woman heard me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, go on, my fine lady,&rdquo; she sneered in savage sarcasm. &ldquo;Go on. You&rsquo;re
      too good ter be zeen a-talkin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; the likes o&rsquo; me. Yer know wot I am. I&rsquo;m
      a woman wot&rsquo;s fallen. I ain&rsquo;t too bad, &rsquo;owsomever, for Mr. Cardover
      to diddle me out o&rsquo; my property. He&rsquo;s a grand man, Mr. Cardover, wi&rsquo; &rsquo;is
      high airs and proud ways. And where do &rsquo;e get them from, I ax. From
      old Cardover&rsquo;s bake-&rsquo;ouse around the corner ter be sure, and from &rsquo;is
      mawther, wot ran orf wi&rsquo; &rsquo;is father and &rsquo;ad the good luck
      ter get married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I interrupted her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry for you,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ve got to
      stop this at once. You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re saying, neither does anyone
      else. Please let us pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stepped in front of us with her plump arms held up in fighting
      attitude, blocking our path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zorry for me. Zorry for me,&rdquo; she laughed, still addressing Ruthita. &ldquo;I
      doan&rsquo;t want &rsquo;is zorrow. Your man&rsquo;s a thief, my gal, and it&rsquo;s the
      likes o&rsquo; him wot despises me&mdash;me as should be Lady Halloway if I &rsquo;ad
      me rights, me as should be livin&rsquo; at Woadley &rsquo;All as zoon as Sir
      Charles be dead and gorn. &rsquo;E says &rsquo;e&rsquo;s zorry for me, wi&rsquo; the
      lawful heir, the child &rsquo;e &rsquo;as robbed, a-standin&rsquo; in &rsquo;is
      sight. The imperdence of &rsquo;im!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave the idiot&rsquo;s hand a vicious jerk, swinging him in front of her, so
      that the lawful heir began to holloa. Someone who had newly joined the
      crowd, inquired what was up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s up, you axed. This gentleman, as &rsquo;e calls &rsquo;isself,
      told &rsquo;is gal to barge inter me. That&rsquo;s wot&rsquo;s up, and I won&rsquo;t stand
      it. &rsquo;E&rsquo;s robbed my kid, wot was heir, o&rsquo; wot belongs ter &rsquo;im.
      And &rsquo;e&rsquo;s robbed my &rsquo;usband, for &rsquo;e&rsquo;s as good as my &rsquo;usband
      in the sight o&rsquo; almighty Gawd. &rsquo;E treats me like a dorg and tells
      &rsquo;is gal to barge inter me, and &rsquo;e thinks I&rsquo;ll stand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While she had been exploding I had tried to back away from her, but she
      followed. Now a policeman&rsquo;s helmet showed above the heads of the
      spectators. Just then the bathing-machine man strolled up from the beach
      out of curiosity. Seeing his daughter the center of disturbance, he fought
      his way to the front and seized her by the wrists with a threatening
      gesture. &ldquo;Yer fool, Lottie,&rdquo; he panted, &ldquo;when are yer goin&rsquo; ter be done
      a-disgracin&rsquo; o&rsquo; me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she was cowed. But as he dragged her away to the
      bathing-machines, she tore one hand free and shook her fist at me. &ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s
      comin&rsquo; down to-morrer,&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve writ and told &rsquo; im wot
      you&rsquo;ve been a-doin&rsquo; at Woadley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruthita was trembling all over with disgust and excitement. I took her
      back to the shop. When I was alone with my grandmother I asked her what
      kind of a woman Lottie was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As nice and kind a little girl as there was in Ransby,&rdquo; she answered,
      &ldquo;until that rascal, Lord Halloway, ruined her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next day I had a chance of judging for myself the worth of Lord Halloway.
      In the afternoon, just as I was going out, I was told that he was waiting
      to see me in the shop. I went to meet him prepared for trouble. I found a
      tall, aristocratic man of about thirty-five, filling up the doorway,
      looking out into the street with his legs wide apart. He was swinging his
      cane and whistling softly. The impression one got from his back-view was
      that he was extremely athletic. When he turned round I saw that he was
      magnificently proportioned, handsome, high com-plexioned, and graceful to
      the point of affectation. When he smiled and held out his hand, his manner
      was so winning that every prejudice was for the moment swamped. He had the
      instinctive art of charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awfully sorry to have to meet you like this for the first time,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re second-cousins, aren&rsquo;t we? Strange how we&rsquo;ve managed to miss one
      another, and being members of the same college and all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had removed his hat, and was leaning against the door-jamb, with his
      legs crossed. I watched him narrowly while he was talking. I had expected
      to see a cultured degenerate&mdash;the worst type of bounder. Instead of
      being exhausted and nervous with a spurious energy, he was almost military
      in his upright carriage. He had a daredevil air of careless command, which
      was so much a part of his breeding that it was impossible to resent it. A
      man would have summed up his vices and virtues leniently by saying that he
      was a gay dog. A good woman might well have fallen in love with him, and
      excused the attraction that his wickedness had for her by saying that she
      was trying to convert him. The only sign of weakness I could detect was a
      light inconsequent laugh, strangely out of keeping with the virility of
      his height and breadth; it was like the vain and meaningless giggle of a
      silly woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked him if he would not come inside. He shook his head, saying that
      this was not a social visit, but that he had come to apologize. Then he
      faced me with an openness of countenance which impressed me as manly, but
      which might have been due to shamelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to tell you how sorry I am for the beastly row you had yesterday.
      Lottie&rsquo;s not a bad sort, but she gets fancies and they run away with her.
      I&rsquo;ve talked with her, and I can promise you it won&rsquo;t happen again. She&rsquo;s
      been writing me angry letters for the past week, ever since you made it up
      with Sir Charles. I was afraid something like this would happen, so I
      thought I&rsquo;d just run down. I wish I&rsquo;d managed to get here earlier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped suddenly, gazing toward the keeping-room door. Ruthita came out
      and crossed the shop. She had on one of her new dresses and was on her way
      to tea with Vi.
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed her with his eyes till she was gone. There was nothing
      insulting in the gallantry with which he admired her; he seemed rather
      surprised&mdash;that was all. For a minute he continued conversing with me
      in an absent-minded manner, then he wished me good-by, hoping that we
      might meet again in Oxford. I walked out on to the pavement and watched
      him down the street. Then I hurriedly fetched my hat and followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might have been accidental and I may have been over-suspicious, but his
      path lay in the same direction as Ruthita&rsquo;s; he never walked so quickly as
      to overtake her or so slowly as not to keep her well in sight. When she
      entered the old flint house, he hesitated, as though the purpose of his
      errand was gone; then, seeing me out of the tail of his eye, he turned
      leisurely to the left down a score. Next day I heard that he had departed
      from Ransby.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not rid myself for many days of the impression this incident had
      created. Like a Hogarth canvas, it typified for me the ugly nemesis of
      illicit passion in all its grotesque nakedness. There was horror in
      connecting such a man as Halloway with such a woman as Lottie. The horror
      was emphasized by the child. Yet Lottie had once been &ldquo;as nice and kind a
      little girl as there was in Ransby,&rdquo; until he destroyed her. Doubtless at
      the time, their sinning had seemed sweet and excusable&mdash;much the same
      as the love of any lover for any lass. Only the result had proved its
      bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      This thought made me go with a tightened rein. When impulse tempted me to
      give way, the memory of that woman with her half-witted child, brazening
      out her shame before a crowd of pleasure-seekers on the sunlit esplanade,
      sprang into my mind and turned me back like the flame of a sword.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII&mdash;THE GARDEN OF TEMPTATION
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was the late
      afternoon of a September day. We had had tea early at the black flint
      house, Vi, Ruthita, Dorrie, and I. After tea a walk had been proposed; but
      Dorrie had said she was &ldquo;tho tired&rdquo; and Ruthita had volunteered to stay
      with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two months Vi and I had never allowed ourselves the chance of being
      alone together; yet every day we had met. To her I was &ldquo;Mr. Cardover&rdquo;; to
      me she was &ldquo;Mrs. Carpenter.&rdquo; Even my grandmother had ceased to suspect
      that any liking deeper than friendship existed between us. She loved to
      have young people about her, and therefore encouraged Vi and Dorrie. She
      thought that we were perfectly safe now that we had Ruthita. Through the
      last two months we four had been inseparable, rambling about, lazy and
      contented. Our conversations had all been general, Vi and I had never
      trusted ourselves to talk of things personal. If, when walking in the
      country, Ruthita and Dorrie had run on ahead to gather wild flowers, we
      had made haste to follow them, so betraying to each other the tantalizing
      fear we had one of another. We were vigilant in postponing the crisis of
      our danger, but neither of us had the strength to bring the danger to an
      end by leaving Ransby, lest our separation should be forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      If our tongues were silent, there were other ways of communicating. Did I
      take her hand to help her over a stile, it trembled. Did I lift her wraps
      and lean over her in placing them about her shoulders, I could see the
      faint rise of her color. Her eyes spoke, mocked, laughed, dared, and
      pleaded, when no other eyes were watching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the one occasion that has been related, Vi had not mentioned her
      husband. Whether he was still urging her to return, or had extended her
      respite, or was on his way to fetch her, I had no means of guessing. I
      lived in a secret delirium of exalted happiness and torturing foreboding.
      Each day as it ended was tragic with farewell. The hour was coming when I
      must return to Oxford and when she must return to America. Soon we should
      have nothing but memories. However well we might disguise our motives for
      dawdling in Ransby, it could not be long before their hollowness would be
      detected. Already Sir Charles had ceased to serve me as an excuse; I had
      not seen him since my departure from Woadley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very suavity of our interchanged courtesies and unsatisfying pretense
      of frank friendship gave edge to my yearning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had come at last to the breaking-point. I did not know it. I still told
      myself that we were both too honorable to step aside: that we had too much
      to lose by it; that I loved her too dearly to let her be anything to me
      unless she could be my wife. The casuistry of this attitude was patent.
    </p>
    <p>
      As my hunger increased I grew more daring. No thoughts that were not of
      her could find room in my mind. I had lost my interest in books&mdash;they
      were mere reports on the thing I was enduring. Nature was only my
      experience made external on a lower physical plane. My imagination swept
      me on to depths and heights which once would have terrified. I grew
      accustomed to picturing myself as the hero of situations which I had
      formerly studied with puzzled amazement in other men&rsquo;s lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The face of Lottie, encountered daily in the gray streets of Ransby, which
      had at first restrained me by reminding me of sin&rsquo;s ultimate ugliness,
      ceased to warn me.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ruthita made the suggestion that we should go for our walk alone
      together, I had expected a prompt refusal from Vi. She rose from the
      disordered tea-table and walked over to the window, turning her back on
      us. I could see by the poise of her head that she was gazing down the
      gardens, across the denes to the wreck, where everything important had
      taken place. I could guess the memories that were in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      From where I sat I could see her head, framed in the window against the
      slate-colored expanse of water, the curved edge of the horizon, and the
      orange-tinted sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creeping across the panes under full sail came a fleet of fishing smacks,
      losing themselves one by one as they advanced into the tangled amber of
      her hair. I counted them, telling myself that she would speak when the
      foremost had re-appeared on the other side. Then it occurred to me that
      she was waiting for me to urge her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Carpenter,&rdquo; I said casually, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t you come? It&rsquo;s going to be a
      jolly evening. We can go by way of St. Margaret&rsquo;s Church to the Broads and
      watch the sunset.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without moving her body, she commenced to drum with her fingers on the
      panes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would take time,&rdquo; she procrastinated. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t get back before
      eight. Who&rsquo;d put Dorrie Darling to bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Ruthita broke in with eagerness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to do it. Dorrie
      and I&rsquo;ll take care of one another and play on the sands till bedtime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yeth, do go,&rdquo; lisped Dorrie. &ldquo;I want Ruthita all to mythelf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These two who had stood between us, for whose sakes we had striven to do
      right, were pushing wide the door that led into the freedom of temptation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shiver ran through her. She turned. The battle against desire in her
      face was ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come,&rdquo; she said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left in the room by myself while they went upstairs to dress, I did not
      think; I abandoned myself to sensations. I could hear their footsteps go
      back and forth above my head. The running ones were Dorrie&rsquo;s. The light,
      quick ones were Ruthita&rsquo;s. The deliberate ones, postponing and anticipating
      forbidden pleasures&mdash;they were Vi&rsquo;s. The sound of her footsteps, so
      stealthy and determined, combined with the long gray sight of the German
      Ocean, sent my mind back to Guinevere&rsquo;s description of her sinning, which
      covered all our joint emotions:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      &ldquo;As if one should
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Slip slowly down some path worn smooth and even,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Down to a cool sea on a summer day;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Yet still in slipping there was some small leaven
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Of stretched hands catching small stones by the way
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Until one surely reached the sea at last,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And felt strange new joy as the worn head lay
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Back, with the hair like sea-weed; yea, all past
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Sweat of the forehead, dryness of the lips
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Washed utterly out by the dear waves o&rsquo;ercast,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In a lone sea, far off from any ships!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She entered. She was alone. The others were not yet ready. I could not
      speak to her. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she whispered hoarsely. Her voice had the distressed
      note of hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      We hastened up the High Street like fugitives. Windows of the stern red
      houses were eyes. They knew all about us. They had watched my mother
      before me; by experience they had become wise. At the top of the town we
      turned to the left, going inland towards the hill on which the tower of
      St. Margaret&rsquo;s rose gray against the sky, beyond which lay the open
      country. We did not walk near together, but with a foot between us. Now we
      slackened our pace and I observed her out of the corners of my eyes. She
      was dressed in white, all billowy and blowy, with a wrap of white lace
      thrown over her shoulders, and a broad white hat from which drooped a blue
      ostrich feather. Whatever had been her intention, she looked bridal. The
      slim slope of her shoulders was unmatronly. Her long neck curved forward,
      giving her an attitude of listening demureness. Her mass of hair and large
      hat scarcely permitted me to see her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      We came to St. Margaret&rsquo;s and passed. Was it a sense of the religious
      restraints that it represented, that made us hurry our footsteps? We
      turned off into a maze of shadowy lanes. We were happier now that we were
      safe from observation. We could no longer fancy that we saw our own
      embarrassment reflected as suspicion in strangers&rsquo; eyes. We drew together.
      My hand brushed hers. She did not start away. I let my fingers close on
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The golden glow of evening was in the tree-tops. The first breath of
      autumn had scorched their leaves to scarlet and russet. Behind their
      branches long scarves of cloud hung pink and green and blood-red. Far
      away, on either side, the yellow standing wheat rustled. Nearer, where it
      had been cut, the soil showed brown beneath the close-cropped stubble.
      Honeysuckle, climbing through the hedges, threw out its fragrance. Evening
      birds were calling. Distantly we could hear the swish of scythes and the
      cries of harvesters to their horses. Hidden from the field-workers, we
      stole between the hedges with the radiant peace of the sunset-on our
      faces. As yet we had said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew her hand free from mine and halted. Scrambling up the bank, she
      pulled down a spray of black-berries. I held the branch while she plucked
      them. We dawdled up the dusty lane, eating them from her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vi,&rdquo; I said softly, &ldquo;we have tried to be only friends. What next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was smiling. She knew that I did not hint at parting. She smiled back
      into my eyes; then looked away sharply. I put my arm about her and drew
      her to me. Without a struggle, she lifted up to me her mouth, all stained
      with blackberries like any school-girl&rsquo;s. I kissed her; a long contented
      sigh escaped her. &ldquo;We have fought against it,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dearest, we have fought against it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A rabbit popped out into the road; seeing us, it doubled and scuttled back
      into the hedge. The smoke of a cottage drifted up in spirals. We
      approached it, walking sedate and separate. A young mother, seated on the
      threshold, was suckling her child. A man, who talked to her while he
      worked, was trimming a rose-bed. They glanced up at us with a friendly
      understanding smile, as much as to say, &ldquo;We were as you are now last
      September.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When a corner of the lane had hidden us, I again placed my arm about her.
      &ldquo;Tell me, what have you to lose by it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lose by it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I know so little of your life. What is he like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flushed as she named him. I nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You always say that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say it because it is all that there is to say. He is a good man, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in spite of that <i>but</i> you married him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I was married to him. He was over forty, and I was only eighteen at
      the time. He was in love with me. My father was a banker; he lent my
      father money to tide him over a crisis. Then they told me I must marry
      him. I was only a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you never loved him? Say you never loved him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her head from my shoulder and looked me in the face with her
      fearless eyes. &ldquo;I never loved him. I have been a sort of daughter to him.
      I scarcely knew what marriage meant until&mdash;until it was all over.
      Then for a time I hated him; I felt myself degraded. Dorrie came. I fought
      against her coming. Then I grew reconciled. I tried to be true to him
      because he was her father. He made me respect him, because he was so
      patient. Dante, when I think of him, I become ashamed of what we are
      doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her nostrils quivered, betraying her suppressed emotion. She had spoken
      with effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you leave him? Did you intend to go back to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She became painfully confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you put so many questions?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you trust me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vi, I trust you so much that for you I&rsquo;m going to alter all my life. I&rsquo;m
      so glad that you too are willing to be daring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why do you question me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I want to be more sure that he has no moral right to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left him,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because I could no longer refuse him. He was
      breaking down my resistance with his terrible kindness. If he had only
      been unjust and had given me some excuse for anger, I could have endured
      it. But day after day went by with its comfort, and its heartache, and its
      outward smoothness. And day after day he was looking older and more
      patient, and making me feel sorrier for him. He got to calling me &lsquo;My
      child.&rsquo; People said how beautiful we were together. I couldn&rsquo;t bear to
      stay and watch him humbling himself and breaking his heart about me. So I
      asked him to let me go traveling with Dorrie. He let me go, thinking that
      absence and a change of scene might teach me how to love him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hid her face against me. It was burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thinks you are coming back again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thinks so in every letter he writes. I thought so too when I went
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vi, you never wear a wedding ring. Why is that if you meant to return to
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to be young just for a little while. They made me a woman when I
      was only a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that was why you taught Dorrie to call you Vi?&rdquo; The pity of it got me
      by the throat. I kissed her eyes as she leant against me. &ldquo;Poor girl, then
      let us forget it.&rdquo; She struggled feebly, making a half-hearted effort to
      tear herself away. &ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t forget it,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t,
      however we try. There&rsquo;s Dorrie. He loves her terribly. He would give me
      anything, except Dorrie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we both love Dorrie,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;we could never do anything that would
      spoil her life&mdash;that would make her ashamed of us one day. You&rsquo;re
      trembling like a leaf, Vi. You mustn&rsquo;t look afraid of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gradually she nestled closer in my embrace. It was not me that she had
      feared, but consequences. We became sparing in our words; words stated
      things too boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming to the end of the lane, we sauntered out on to a broad white road.
      It wound across long flat marshes where the wind from the sea is never
      quiet. The marshes are intersected with dikes and ditches, dotted with
      windbreaks for the cattle, and bridged here and there with planks. One can
      see for miles. There is nothing to break the distance save square Norman
      towers of embowered churches in solitary hamlets and oddly barrel-shaped
      windmills with sails turning, for all the world like stout giants,
      gesticulating and pummeling the sky. Here the orchestra of nature is
      always practising; its strings, except when a storm is brewing, are muted.
      From afar comes the constant bass of the sea, striking the land in deep
      arpeggios. Drawing nearer is the soprano humming of the wind or the
      staccato cry of some startled bird. Then comes a multitude of intermittent
      soloists,&mdash;frogs croaking, reeds rustling, cattle lowing, the
      rumbling wheels of a wagon. They clamor in subdued ecstasy, now singly and
      now together. Through all their song runs the murmuring accompaniment of
      water lapping.
    </p>
    <p>
      In gleaming curves across this green wilderness flow fresh-water lagoons
      and rivers which are known as the Broads. Dotted with water-lilies,
      barriered with bulrushes, they reflect the sky&rsquo;s vast emptiness. Brimming
      their channels they slip over into the meadows, flashing like quicksilver
      through ashen sedges.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had vanished. The lip of the horizon was scarlet. The dust of
      twilight was drifting down. In this primitive spaciousness and freedom
      one&rsquo;s thoughts expanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vi,&rdquo; I whispered, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re two sensible persons. Of what have we to be
      afraid? Only ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The future doesn&rsquo;t belong to us. We have the present. All our lives we&rsquo;ve
      wanted to be happy. Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s spoil our happiness now that we have it.
      Just for to-night we&rsquo;ll forget you&rsquo;re married. We&rsquo;ll be lovers together&mdash;as
      alone as if no one else was in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And afterwards?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afterwards I&rsquo;ll wait for you. Afterwards can take care of itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The misshapen shadow of sin which had followed and stood between us,
      holding us at arm&rsquo;s length, awkward and embarrassed, was banished. If this
      was sin, then wrongdoing was lovely.
    </p>
    <p>
      We began to talk of how everything had happened&mdash;how, out of the
      great nothingness of the unknown, we had been flung together. How easy it
      would have been for us to have lived out our lives in ignorance of one
      another and therefore free from this temptation. We justified ourselves in
      the belief that our meeting had been fated. It could not have been
      avoided. We were pawns on a chess-board, manipulated by the hand of an
      unseen player. We had tried to escape one another and had been forced
      together against our wills. The outcome of the game did not come within
      the ruling of our decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theory brought re-assurance. It excused us. We were not responsible.
      Then my mind fled back to my mother. She and my father had had these same
      thoughts as they had wandered side by side through these same fields and
      hedges. Why had I been brought back to the country of their courting to
      pass through their ordeal?
    </p>
    <p>
      Night was coming down, covering up landmarks. Darkness lent our actions
      modesty; they lost something of their sharpened meaning because we could
      not see ourselves acting. We lived unforgettable moments. Passing over
      narrow plank-bridges from meadow to meadow, we seemed to be traveling out
      of harsh reality into a world which was dream-created.
    </p>
    <p>
      She carried her hat in her hand. A soft wind played in her hair and
      loosened it in places. Her filmy white dress was all a-flutter. Mists
      began to rise from the marshlands, making us vague to one another.
      Traveling out of the east swam the harvest moon, nearing its fullness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vi,&rdquo; I whispered, taking both her hands in mine, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know yourself&mdash;you&rsquo;re
      splendid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed up into my eyes with elfin daring and abandon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the kind of woman for whom a man would willingly die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to know that,&rdquo; she mocked me, &ldquo;for one tried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this were five hundred years ago, do you know what I&rsquo;d do to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t five hundred years ago&mdash;that makes all the difference. But,
      if it were, what would you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d ride off with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should. I shouldn&rsquo;t care what happened a week later. They might kill me
      like a robber. It wouldn&rsquo;t matter&mdash;a week alone with you would have
      been worth it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she insisted; &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t ride off with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t I? And why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She freed her hands from mine and placed her arms about my neck. The
      laughter had gone from her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Dante, you wouldn&rsquo;t do it, because <i>you</i> are <i>you</i>.&rdquo; The
      burning thoughts I had had died down. We wandered on in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ahead of us a flickering light sprang up. Out of curiosity we went towards
      it. We found ourselves treading a rutted field-path which led back in the
      direction of the main road. Out of the mist grew up a clump of
      marsh-poplars. The light became taller and redder. We saw that it was the
      beginning of a camp-fire. Over the flames hung a stooping figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The figure turned. It was that of a shriveled mummy of a woman&mdash;gray-haired,
      fantastic, bent, with face seamed and lined from exposure. A yellow shawl
      covered her head and shoulders. She held a burning twig in her hand, with
      which she was lighting her pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening, mother. Good luck to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nowt o&rsquo; luck th&rsquo; day, lad,&rdquo; she grumbled. &ldquo;All the folks is in the fields
      at th&rsquo; &rsquo;arvest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We seated ourselves at the blaze. She went back into the darkness. We
      heard the snapping of branches. She returned out of the clump of poplars
      with a companion; each of them was carrying a bundle of dead wood for
      fuel. Her companion was a younger woman of about thirty. She nodded to us
      with a proud air of gipsy defiance and sat herself down on the far side of
      the fire, holding her face away from the light of the flames. The one
      glimpse I had had of her had shown me that she was handsome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s bin nowt o&rsquo; luck th&rsquo; day,&rdquo; the older woman continued. &ldquo;They
      hain&rsquo;t got their wage for th&rsquo; &rsquo;arvest yet and they be too cumbered
      wi&rsquo; work for fortune-tellin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you tell fortunes?&rdquo; asked Vi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I tell fortunes!&rdquo; the crone repeated scornfully. &ldquo;I should think I did
      tell fortunes. Every kind o&rsquo; folk comes ter me wot wants ter read the
      future. Farmers whose sheep is dyin&rsquo;. Wimmem as wants childen and hasn&rsquo;t
      got &rsquo;em. Gals as is goin&rsquo; ter have childen and oughtn&rsquo;t ter have &rsquo;em.
      Wives whose &rsquo;usbands don&rsquo;t love &rsquo;em. Lovers as want ter get
      married, but shouldn&rsquo;t. Lovers as should get married, but don&rsquo;t want ter.
      They all comes to their grannie. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot o&rsquo; human natur&rsquo; in my
      day, I &rsquo;ave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you tell them?&rdquo; asked Vi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell &rsquo;em wot&rsquo;s preparin&rsquo; for or agen &rsquo;em. I read th&rsquo;
      stars and I warn &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can they escape by taking your advice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s more&rsquo;n I can say. Thar was Joe Moyer, wot was hanged at Norwich
      for murthering &rsquo;is sweetheart. I telt &rsquo;im.&lsquo;is fortune a year
      ago come St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day. &lsquo;Joe,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;your &rsquo;and &rsquo;ll
      be red before the poppies blow agen and you neck &rsquo;ll be bruk before
      th&rsquo; wheat is ripe. Leave off a-goin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; &rsquo;er,&rsquo; says I. And the
      lassie a-standin&rsquo; thar by &rsquo;is side, she laughs at her grannie. But
      it all come true, wot I telt &rsquo;im.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you read the stars for me?&rdquo; asked Vi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was so thin and eager that it pierced me like a knife. I
      quivered with fearful anticipation. All our future might depend on what
      this hag by the roadside might say. I did not want to hear her. She might
      release terror from the ghost-chamber of conscience. However much we
      scoffed at her words, they would influence our actions and haunt our
      minds. Who could say, perhaps Joe Moyer would never have murdered his
      sweetheart and would not have been hanged at Norwich, if she hadn&rsquo;t
      suggested his crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vi,&rdquo; I said sternly, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t believe in fortune-telling. We must be
      going; it&rsquo;s getting late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hee-hee-hee!&rdquo; the gipsy tittered, &ldquo;if she don&rsquo;t believe in
      fortune-tellin&rsquo;, we knows who do. Come, don&rsquo;t be afeard, me dearie. Cross
      me &rsquo;and wi siller and I&rsquo;ll read the stars for &rsquo;ee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vi crossed her palm with a shilling. The gipsy flung fresh twigs on the
      fire, that she might study the lines in Vi&rsquo;s hands more clearly. As the
      flames shot up, they illumined the other woman. Her features were strongly
      Romany, dark and fierce and shy. Somewhere I had seen them; their memory
      was pleasant. She regarded me fixedly, as though in a trance, across the
      fire. She too was trying to remember. Then, rising noiselessly, she stole
      like a panther into the poplars away from the circle of light. From out
      there in the darkness I felt that her eyes were still watching.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old fortune-teller had flung back her shawl from her head. Her
      grizzled hair broke loose about her shoulders. She was peering over Vi&rsquo;s
      hand, tracing out the lines with the stem of her foul pipe. Every now and
      then she paused to ask a whispered question or make a whispered statement.
      Now she would look up at the stars, and now would pucker her brows. Her
      head was near to Vi&rsquo;s. The flames jumped up and showed their faces
      clearly: the one white and pure, and crowned with gold; the other cunning,
      mahogany-colored, and witch-like. The flames died down; the shadows danced
      in again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I drew nearer and heard the gipsy muttering, &ldquo;You was born under Venus,
      dearie. Love&rsquo;ll be the makin&rsquo; o&rsquo; yer, an&rsquo; love&rsquo;ll be the ruin o&rsquo; yer.
      You&rsquo;ll always be longin&rsquo; an&rsquo; longin&rsquo; an&rsquo; lookin&rsquo; for the face o&rsquo; &rsquo;im
      as is comin&rsquo;. You&rsquo;re married, dearie, but it warn&rsquo;t to the right &lsquo;un, and
      yer&rsquo;ve &lsquo;ad childen by &lsquo;un. Cross me &lsquo;and wi&rsquo; siller, dearie. Cross me &lsquo;and
      wi&rsquo; siller. I can&rsquo;t see plain. That&rsquo;s better. Now I see un. &rsquo;E&rsquo;s
      comin&rsquo;, dearie, and &rsquo;e&rsquo;ll be tall and masterfu&rsquo;, yer &lsquo;ll &rsquo;ave
      ter sin ter get &rsquo;un. Aye, it&rsquo;s all writ &rsquo;ere, but it gets
      mazed&mdash;the lines rin t&rsquo;gether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dragged Vi&rsquo;s hand lower to the ground, nearer the fire. She was
      excited and clearly puzzled. She kept on croaking out what she had said
      already, &ldquo;Yer &rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave ter sin ter get &lsquo;un. It&rsquo;s all writ &rsquo;ere.
      Aye, but it can&rsquo;t be&mdash;it can&rsquo;t be for sartin. It gets all mazed and
      tangled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head, blinking across the blaze to where her companion had
      been sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lil, Lil,&rdquo; she cried hoarsely, &ldquo;come &rsquo;ere. I can&rsquo;t see plain.
      Young eyes is better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lil emerged out of the shadows, treading as softly as retribution
      following temptation. She bent over the hand, unraveling the lines to
      which the fortune-teller pointed with her pipe-stem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lil! Lil! Where had I heard that name before? The wind rustled the leaves
      of the poplars and caused the ash of the fire to scatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever he hears your voice, it shall speak to him of me. If he goes
      where you do not grow, oh, grass, then the trees shall call him back. If
      he goes where you do not grow, oh, trees, then the wind shall tell him.
      His hand shall be as ours, against the works of men. When he hears your
      voices, he shall turn his face from walls and come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to know the future?&rdquo; she asked, peering into Vi&rsquo;s face
      gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vi hesitated. &ldquo;Is it so terrible?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not terrible as we gipsies reckon it; but sweet and dangerous and
      reckless, and it ends in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lilith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I caught her by the wrist. She shot upright and faced me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me? I&rsquo;m Dante&mdash;Dante Cardover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vi had sunk upon her knees and stared up at us, steadying herself with her
      hands. The old hag gazed angrily from behind Lilith, stretching out her
      long thin neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember you, brother,&rdquo; said Lilith. &ldquo;You are one of us. I knew that
      one day you would hear us calling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wot did &rsquo;ee see in the lady&rsquo;s &rsquo;and?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fortune-teller laid a skinny claw on Lilith&rsquo;s shoulder; her voice
      quavered with eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not tell,&rdquo; said Lilith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did &rsquo;ee see&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lilith clapped her hand over the woman&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;You shan&rsquo;t tell,
      grannie,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not good to tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Down the field-track came the creaking sound of wheels. I looked up and
      saw through the poplars the swinging lanterns of a caravan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vi touched me on the arm. She was unnerved and trembling. &ldquo;Take me home,
      Dante.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned to Lilith. &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G&rsquo;liath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;ll you be camping to-morrow? At Woadley Ham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A cloud passed over her face. &ldquo;We never camp there, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crone broke in with a spiteful titter: &ldquo;But we used ter, until she
      wouldn&rsquo;t let us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lilith spoke hastily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to Yarminster Fair. We get there
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll see you there,&rdquo; I told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The caravan had come to a halt. I could see the tall form of G&rsquo;liath
      moving about the horses. I did not want to meet him just then. Skirting
      the encampment, we hurried off across fields to the highroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sleepy irritable landlady opened the door to Vi. By the time I had
      walked down the High Street to the shop, it was nearly midnight. Ruthita
      was sitting up for me; my grandmother had been in bed two hours. She eyed
      me curiously. &ldquo;You had a long walk,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, longer than we expected.&rdquo; I spoke brusquely. I was afraid she would
      question me.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the top of the stairs, just as I was entering my room, she stole near
      to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dante, ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you going to kiss me good-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was bending perfunctorily over her lifted face, when I saw by the light
      of the candle in my hand that her eyes were red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruthie, you little goose, you&rsquo;ve been crying. What&rsquo;ve you been crying
      about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not,&rdquo; she denied indignantly, and broke from me. After she had
      entered her room I tiptoed down the passage and listened outside her door.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the stillness of the house I could hear her sobbing.

      CHAPTER VIII&mdash;THE WAY OF ALL FLESH
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>or good luck&rsquo;s
      sake smile, Ruthita,&rdquo; said my grandmother. &ldquo;There you&rsquo;ve sat all through
      breakfast lookin&rsquo; like a week o&rsquo; Sundays, with your face as long as a yard
      o&rsquo; pump water. What&rsquo;s the matter with you, child? Ain&rsquo;t you well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw the brightness come into Ruthita&rsquo;s eyes and the lashes tremble. I
      knew by the signs that directly she heard her own voice she would begin to
      cry, so I answered for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you what&rsquo;s the matter. I upset her last night. It was nearly
      twelve when I got home from my walk with Mrs. Carpenter. Ruthie&rsquo;d got
      herself all worked up. Thought we&rsquo;d been getting drowned again or
      something, didn&rsquo;t you, Ruthie? It was too bad of me to keep her sitting up
      so late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A heavy silence fell. Ruthita dropped her eyes, trying to recover her
      composure. My grandmother&rsquo;s face masked itself in a non-committal stare.
      She gazed past me out of the window, and seemed to hold her breath; only
      the faint tinkling of the gold chain against the jet of her bodice, told
      how her breath came and went. She had placed her hand on the coffee-pot as
      I began to speak. When I ended, it stayed there motionless. From the
      bake-house across the courtyard came the bump, bang, bump of the bakers
      pounding the dough into bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you stayed out with Mrs. Carpenter till nearly twelve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My grandmother never used dialect when she wished to be impressive. Her
      tones were icily refined and haughty&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I recognized them as belonging to her company manners. She could be
      crushingly aloof and dignified when her sense of the moralities was
      offended. She had practised her talent for &ldquo;settin&rsquo; folks down and makin&rsquo;
      &rsquo;em feel like three penn&rsquo;orth o&rsquo; happence&rdquo; to some purpose on
      grizzled sea-captains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, till nearly twelve. It was pretty late, wasn&rsquo;t it? We met some
      interesting people camping on the marshlands&mdash;old friends of mine and
      Ruthita&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! And you walked back from the Broads about midnight with a married
      woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. It wasn&rsquo;t much after ten when we started back. Time passed
      quickly; we didn&rsquo;t realize how late it was getting. It didn&rsquo;t matter,
      except for Ruthita. It was bright moonlight. The country looked perfect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must ha&rsquo; done,&rdquo; said my grandmother sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It did. Some day we must try it all together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who were your interesting friends? Respectable people, no doubt, to
      be camping on the marshlands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t respectable. They were gipsies.&rdquo; Then, turning to Ruthita,
      &ldquo;It was Lilith that we met. You remember Lilith of Epping Forest&mdash;that
      time we ran away to get married. Fancy meeting her after all these years!
      And just as I left, I saw G&rsquo;liath drive up. I could swear it was the same
      old caravan, Ruthie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Curiosity and love of romance melted my grandmother&rsquo;s reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G&rsquo;liath! Why, that&rsquo;s the gipsy family to which Sir Charles&rsquo;s mother
      belonged. They must be kind o&rsquo; relatives o&rsquo; yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose they must. I never thought of that. I&rsquo;ll have to ask Lilith
      about it. They were on their way to Yarminster Fair. We&rsquo;ll run over and
      see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the errand boy, who was minding the shop, tapped at the
      keeping-room door and handed in a note for me. I saw that it was unstamped
      and addressed in a handwriting that I did not recognize.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did this come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It war left jist nar acrost the counter by a sarvant-gal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruthita was telling my grandmother all that she could remember of Lilith.
      I ripped open the envelope and read:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Something has happened. Must see you at once. Come as soon as you can.
      Vi.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your letter from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Mrs. Carpenter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Carpenter again! What does she want? It&rsquo;s not more&rsquo;n nine hours
      since you saw her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wants my advice on&mdash;on a business matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! I &rsquo;ope she may profit by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I was sauntering out of the shop Ruthita called after me in her high
      clear voice, &ldquo;Going to take me to Yarminster to-day, Dante?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know yet. I&rsquo;ll tell you later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Until I reached the top of the street I strolled jauntily; I was sure I
      was being watched. I had left an atmosphere of jealous annoyance and
      baffled suspicion behind. It was absurd to be nursed and guarded by
      affectionate relatives in the way I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was puzzled by Vi&rsquo;s note. I worked out all kinds of conjectures as I
      jostled my way through fisher-girls and sailors up the High Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was shown into the room at the back of the black flint house, which
      overlooked the sea. The windows were open wide; wind fluttered the
      curtains. Breakfast things were only partially cleared from the table.
      Upstairs I could hear Dorrie&rsquo;s piping voice and, now and then, could catch
      a phrase of what she was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me thee him too, Vi. Oh, pleath. No, I don&rsquo;t want to play wiv Annie.
      I want to play wiv Dante.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I heard the thump, thump, thump of Dorrie stumping from stair to
      stair by way of protest, and the heavy step of Annie taking her forcibly
      to the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vi descended a moment later. She entered without eagerness, shutting the
      door carefully behind her. There was never anything of hurry or neglect in
      her appearance; she always looked fresh and trimly attired. The high color
      in her usually pale cheeks was the only sign of perturbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She crossed the room towards me with a slow, swaying motion, and halted a
      foot away, holding out her hand. I took it in mine, pressing it gently.
      Her mouth was quivering. She was making an effort to be formally polite
      and was not succeeding. The soft rustling of her skirts, the slow rise and
      fall of her bosom, her delicate fragrance and timid beauty&mdash;everything
      about her was bewilderingly feminine. What arguments, I wondered, what
      campaigns of caution, what capitulations of wild desires to duty were
      going on behind that smooth white forehead? My grip on her hand tightened;
      I drew her to me. Her cold remoteness added to my yearning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? Why did you send for me? You&rsquo;ve changed since last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew her hand free from mine. I saw that, for the first time since I
      had known her, she was wearing a band of gold upon her wedding-finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over, Dante.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She whispered the words, wringing her hands and staring away from me out
      to sea. I slipped my arm about her shoulder. &ldquo;It can never be all over,
      dearest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For answer she handed me a letter. It bore a United States stamp and was
      addressed to her in a bold, emphatic, perpendicular hand which revealed
      the writer&rsquo;s vigorous determination of character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From my husband. Read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Standing a little apart from her at the window, I drew out a carefully
      folded letter. It was dated from Sheba, Massachusetts, nine days previous
      to its arrival. While I read it, I watched her stealthily, how she stood
      charmingly irresolute, twisting the gold-band off and on her finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>My dearest Vi:</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>I have written you many times, asking you to fix definitely the day of
      your return. You&rsquo;ve put me off with all kinds of excuses. Latterly you
      have not even referred to my question. My dear child, don&rsquo;t think I blame
      you; you probably have your own reasons for what you are doing. But people
      are beginning to talk about us here. For your own sake you ought to
      return. We&rsquo;ve always tried to play fair by one another. You were always
      game, Vi; and now it&rsquo;s up to you.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>I&rsquo;m lonely. I want my little Dorrie. Most of all I want my wife. I
      can&rsquo;t stand this absence much longer. On receipt of this send me a cable
      &ldquo;Coming,&rdquo; followed by the date of your sailing. If I don&rsquo;t receive such a
      cable within ten days of mailing this letter, I shall jump on a boat and
      come over. I don&rsquo;t distrust you, but I&rsquo;m worn out with waiting. Can&rsquo;t you
      understand how I want you? Nothing in the world matters to me, my child,
      except you.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Your affectionate husband,</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Randall.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      I re-folded it methodically and returned it to the envelope. I tried to
      picture this man who had sent it. He was manifestly elderly. Probably he
      was portly, a trifle pompous and genially paternal in his manners. What
      volumes his trick of calling her &ldquo;my child&rdquo; revealed concerning their
      relations. I contrasted him with Vi. Vi with her eager youth, her passion
      to taste life&rsquo;s rapture, her slim white body so alluring and so gracious,
      her physical fineness, her possibilities for bestowing and receiving
      natural joy. If I let her go, she would slowly lose her zest for life. She
      would forget that she was a woman and would sink prematurely into stolid
      middle-age. Her possibilities of motherhood would slip from her untaken
      and never to be renewed. The little rascals, with golden hair and features
      which should perpetuate her beauty, would never be born to her. Those
      children should be hers and mine. <i>Hers and mine</i>. How the words beat
      upon my brain! They were like the fists of little children, battering
      against the closed doors of existence. It was monstrous that the justice
      of this husband&rsquo;s claim to her should be based on his injustice in having
      married her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I formed my mental picture of him, formed it with the cruel sarcasm
      of youth. His body was deteriorated; his skin puckered and yellow; the
      fine lines of suppleness and straightness gone; the muscles flabby and
      jaded. Then I looked at her: gold and ivory, with poppies for a mouth.
      Sweet and nobly chaste. A woman to set a man on fire&mdash;to drive him to
      the extremes of sorrow or gladness. A woman to sin for.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned from the window and took one step towards her. I could feel her
      body throbbing against mine. The fierce sweet ecstasy of my delight hurt
      her. I saw nothing but her eyes. All else in the world was darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; she panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to go?&rdquo; I whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sank her head on my shoulder. Her arms were about my neck. I could
      only see her golden hair. Her answer came to me broken and muffled. &ldquo;No,
      no, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I carried her to the sofa and knelt beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t ever despise me, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How absurd her question sounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without any reference to our ultimate purpose, we set about making our
      plans. We must get away from Ransby. We must not be seen together any more
      that day. We would meet at the station that evening, and travel up to
      London together by the train leaving Ransby at six-thirty-eight. Our plans
      went no further.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that all had been arranged, a new embarrassment arose between us&mdash;a
      sweet shamefulness. She clung to me, yet she cast down her eyes, her
      cheeks encrimsoned, not daring to look me in the face. We touched one
      another shyly and shuddered at the contact. Our hearts were too full for
      words, our thoughts too primitively intimate to be expressed. The veils
      had dropped from our eyes. The mystery of mysteries lay exposed. We saw
      one another, natural in our passions&mdash;exiles from society. No
      artificial restraints stood between us; in our conduct with one another we
      were free to be governed by our own desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      A scurry of little feet in the passage. The sound of heavier ones
      pursuing. We sprang apart. Dorrie entered, running with her arms stretched
      out towards me. &ldquo;Catch me, Dante. Don&rsquo;t let her get me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rueful face of Annie appeared in the doorway; her plump arms covered
      to the elbows with flour. &ldquo;If &rsquo;ee please, mum,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it
      warn&rsquo;t no fault o&rsquo; mine. She nipped out afore I could get a-holt o&rsquo; her,
      while I war a-makin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the pudden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re juth horwid,&rdquo; cried Dorrie. &ldquo;Go &rsquo;way. I want to thpeak to
      Dante.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She scrambled on my knee, clutching tightly to my coat till Annie had
      vanished. Then she tossed her curls out of her eyes, and told me all that
      she and Ruthita had done together on the previous evening. While she was
      talking, I watched Vi, trying to realize the seemingly impossible truth
      that she had promised herself to me, and would soon be mine. A host of
      bewildering images rushed through my mind as I gazed into the future. I
      was amazed at myself that I should feel no fear of the step which we
      contemplated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old thtupid,&rdquo; cried Dorrie in an aggrieved voice, &ldquo;you weren&rsquo;t
      lithening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smoothed her baby fingers up and down my face, coaxing me to give her
      my attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry, little lady, but I must be going. You must tell me all about it
      some other time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All wite,&rdquo; she acquiesced contentedly; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a pwomith,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vi accompanied me to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What wath you thaying?&rdquo; asked Dorrie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, my darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My grandmother was sitting behind her counter, knitting, when I entered.
      She sank her chin and looked at me humorously over her spectacles. &ldquo;Well,
      my man of business, did she take your advice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Why shouldn&rsquo;t she? She&rsquo;s seen my grannie, and knows how she&rsquo;s
      profited by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clever boy,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;Who made your shirt? When a man of business
      is born among the Cardovers, pears&rsquo;ll grow on pines. Look at your father.
      Look at the Spuffler. Look at yourself. I hope she won&rsquo;t act on it. What
      was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell you now. I find I&rsquo;ve got to run up to London to-night and I&rsquo;ve
      promised to take Ruthie to Yarminster. There&rsquo;s only just time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s takin&rsquo; you to London? You didn&rsquo;t say anythin&rsquo; about it this
      marnin&rsquo;.&rdquo; She dropped her knitting in her lap. &ldquo;Dante, is it anythin&rsquo; to
      do with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She beckoned me nearer to her. I leant over the counter. She glanced
      meaningly towards the door of the keeping-room. I stooped lower till our
      heads nearly touched. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better stay there, laddie,&rdquo; she whispered.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinkin&rsquo; and usin&rsquo; me eyes. This ain&rsquo;t no place fur you at
      present. She&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; too fond of you and you of her. I know.&rdquo; She
      nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been through it. I watched your pa at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what you and Mrs. Carpenter are doin&rsquo;. Don&rsquo;t pretend you&rsquo;re a fool,
      Dante, &rsquo;cause you&rsquo;re not&mdash;and neither is your old grannie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then Ruthita looked out of the keeping-room. I was glad of the excuse
      to cut this dangerous conversation short. &ldquo;Hurry up, Ruthie; get on your
      togs. I&rsquo;m going to drive you over to Yarminster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she had gone, my grandmother turned to me again. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s another
      of &rsquo;em. Lovers can&rsquo;t keep their secrets to theirselves nohow&mdash;they
      give theirselves away with every breath. Did ye see the way she flushed
      wi&rsquo; pleasure? She&rsquo;s a tender little maid. If you made her unhappy, though
      she&rsquo;s none o&rsquo; my body, I&rsquo;d never forgive ye, Dante. If you don&rsquo;t intend to
      marry &rsquo;er, be careful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish,&rdquo; I exclaimed and went out into the street to fetch round a
      dog-cart from the livery-stables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, rubbish is well enough,&rdquo; was my grandmother&rsquo;s final retort; &ldquo;but
      broken eggs can&rsquo;t be mended. No more can broken hearts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was just room enough on the front-seat to take the two of us. As I
      drove down the street I saw Ruthita come out of the shop and stand waiting
      on the pavement. She looked modest and pretty as a sprig of lavender.
      There was always something quaintly virginal about her, as though she had
      stepped out of an old English love-song. Her eyes were unusually bright
      this morning with the pleasure of anticipation. With subtle flattery, she
      had put on one of the gowns I had bought her. It was her way of saying,
      &ldquo;This day is to be mine and yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I do you proud?&rdquo; she laughed, using one of Vi&rsquo;s Americanisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I said, with pretended harshness, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think where
      you got such a dunducketty old dress from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man gave it me. Didn&rsquo;t he show bad taste?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He showed himself a perfect ass. Now, if I were to buy you a dress,
      Ruthie, which of course I shan&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, get off with you, you rascals. What&rsquo;re you a-doin&rsquo;, blockin&rsquo; up my
      pavement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grandmother Cardover stood in the doorway, her hands folded beneath her
      black satin apron, her keys jangling. The gray cork-screw curls from under
      her cap were wobbling; her plump little body was shaking with enjoyment.
      All her crossness and caution on Vi&rsquo;s account were gone at seeing Ruthita
      and myself together. We started up at a smart trot. As we turned the
      corner into the High Street, we looked back. She was still there, gazing
      after us.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the road which follows the coast, Yarminster is eight miles from
      Ransby. I turned inland by a roundabout route; I wanted to pass through
      Woadley.
    </p>
    <p>
      My spirits ran high with the thought of what was to happen shortly. I was
      in a mood to be gay. Clouds were flying high. The country lay windswept
      and golden in the sunshine. The air had the sharp tang of autumn&mdash;the
      acrid fragrance which foretells the decay of foliage. A pleasant
      melancholy lurked in the reds and yellows of woods and hedges. Tops of
      trees were already growing thin of leaves where the gales had harried
      them. Pasturing in harvested fields, flocks of sheep lent a touch of
      grayness to the landscape. Here and there overhead gulls hovered, or slid
      down the sky on poised wings, as though brooding on the summer that was
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruthita and I spoke of Lilith, recalling childhood&rsquo;s days. We laughed over
      our amazement at discovering that her back was no longer humpy&mdash;that
      her baby had left her. Then we fell to wondering whether she had ever been
      married and what was her story. Our conversation became intimate and
      confessional. I had never known much of Ruthita&rsquo;s secret thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dante,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;why did they leave us to find out everything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I slowed the horse down to a walk. &ldquo;I know what you mean, Ruthie. They
      brought us up on fables. They left us to fight with all kinds of fantastic
      imaginings. They allowed us to infer that so many things were shameful.
      D&rsquo;you remember what a fuss they made when they found that the Bantam had
      kissed you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, casting down her eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never got over it. It&rsquo;s made me
      awkward with men&mdash;self-conscious and afraid of...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet they were kind to us, Ruthie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they never treated us honestly,&rdquo; she said sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same intense look, a look almost of hunger, which transformed her,
      came into her face&mdash;the look which the flash-light had revealed to me
      that night on the denes. Sudden fear of what we might say next made me
      shake up the horse. The jolting of the wheels prevented us from conversing
      save by raising our voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      We passed a man on the road. He shouted after us.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first I thought he was chaffing. He kept on shouting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you stop?&rdquo; said Ruthita. &ldquo;We may have dropped something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had turned a bend. I looked back, but could not see him. I halted until
      he should come up. A big-framed man in a shooting-jacket, gaiters, and
      knickerbockers came swinging round the corner. I was surprised to
      recognize in him Lord Halloway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloa,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re going in my direction. Would you mind giving
      me a lift as far as Woadley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;This horse is restive. I can&rsquo;t leave the reins. I
      suppose you can lower the back-seat without help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew level on the far-side from me and stood with his hand resting on
      the splashboard, gazing at Ruthita. &ldquo;My sister,&rdquo; I said shortly. .
    </p>
    <p>
      While he lowered the back and drew but the seat, he explained himself.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to Woadley to look after some farms my father owns round
      there.&rdquo; What he was really saying was, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to try to cut you
      out with Sir Charles, so you needn&rsquo;t fear me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His manner was friendly. He had gained a high color with his walking. He
      looked brilliantly handsome and manly, with just that touch of indolence
      about him that gave him his charm. Without being warned, no one would have
      guessed that he was a rake. In his presence even I disbelieved half the
      wild tales of dissipation I had heard narrated of him. Yet, when my
      distrust of him was almost at rest, he would arouse it with his inane,
      high-pitched laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had clambered in and we had started, I began to tell him, for the
      sake of conversation, where we were traveling. At the mention of Lilith,
      he interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lilith! Lilith! Seem to remember the name. Was she ever in these parts
      before? There was a little girl named Lilith, who used to camp with the
      Goliaths, the gipsies, on Woadley Ham. They haven&rsquo;t been there for years.
      I recall her distinctly. She was wild and dark. I used to watch her
      breaking in ponies when I was a boy stopping with Sir Charles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must be the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might tell her that you met me, when you see her,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She was
      the pluckiest little horsewoman for her age I ever saw. She could ride
      anything. I can see her now, gripping a young hunter I had with her brown
      bare legs, fighting his head off. It&rsquo;s odd that you should have mentioned
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tailed off into his giggling girlish laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little he commenced to address his remarks exclusively to
      Ruthita. This was natural, for I could not turn round to converse with him
      because of attending to the horse. I observed him out of the corner of my
      eye, and began to understand the secret of his power over women. For one
      thing he talked entirely to a woman, bestowing on her an intensity of
      attention which many would consider flattering. Then again he put a woman
      at her ease, drawing her out and speaking of things which were within her
      depth. Most of the topics which he drifted into were personal. When he
      mentioned himself, he lowered his voice as if he were confessing. When he
      mentioned her, his tones became earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was surprised to see how Ruthita, usually so reticent, lowered her guard
      to his attack. She twisted round on her seat, that she might watch him.
      Her face grew merry and her eyes twinkled with fun and laughter. She was
      being, what she had declared she never was&mdash;natural with a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the corner of my eye I saw one thing which displeased me immensely.
      With apparent unconsciousness, Halloway&rsquo;s arm was slipping farther and
      farther along the back of the seat against which Ruthita rested. A little
      more, and it would have encircled her. But before that was accomplished,
      he stopped short, leaving nothing to complain of. He was simply steadying
      himself in a jolting dog-cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      We entered Woadley and passed the tall gates of the Park. I had a glimpse
      of the Hall through the trees, and the peacocks strutting where the
      gardens began and the meadowland left off. I smiled to myself as I
      wondered what would happen if Sir Charles should meet Halloway and myself
      together. Two miles out of Woadley Ruthita and my cousin were still
      industriously chatting. I had my suspicions as to the urgency of his
      errand. Then the arm slid an inch further along the back-rail of the seat.
      That inch made his attitude barely pardonable. I reined in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say you were going to Woadley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;I have to get out at the next cross-road and
      walk. The farms are over in that direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swept a belt of woodland vaguely. He lied consummately. His face told
      me nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s the next cross-road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My manner was churlish. He refused to acknowledge anything hostile in my
      tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully grateful to you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve saved me a long walk and
      I&rsquo;ve enjoyed your company immensely.&rdquo; As he spoke the last words he smiled
      directly into the eyes of Ruthita. &ldquo;I shall hope to meet Miss Cardover
      again&mdash;perhaps at Oxford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not think it necessary to tell him that Ruthita&rsquo;s surname was not
      Cardover but Favart. We watched him stride away, clean-limbed and splendid&mdash;a
      man who had sinned discreetly and bore no physical marks of his
      shortcomings.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Ruthita spoke. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t let him know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He made me forget. He made me remember I was a woman. No man&rsquo;s ever
      spoken to me as he spoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a clever fellow to make you forget the esplanade and Lottie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re angry,&rdquo; she laughed, and snuggled closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      We entered the old marketplace of Yarminster where the Fair was being
      held. Leaving our horse at <i>The Anchor</i> to be baited, we threaded our
      way between booths and whirligo-rounds. Presently I heard a familiar cry,
      &ldquo;Two shies a penny. Two shies a penny. Every ball &rsquo;its a cocoanut.
      Down she goes. Walk up. Walk up. Two shies a penny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dodging up and down behind the pitch, was G&rsquo;liath, not much altered. The
      gaudy woman was absent; it was Lilith who was serving out the balls to the
      country bumpkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Ruthita,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You remember the little girl in the Forest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went on catching the wooden balls which G&rsquo;liath returned to her. Trade
      was busy. Between reiterating his call, she conversed with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember. (Two shies a penny). It doesn&rsquo;t seem long ago. (Every ball &rsquo;its
      a cocoanut. Walk up). How long is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best part of fourteen years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was difficult to carry on a conversation under the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to ask you about last night,&rdquo; I whispered. &ldquo;When&rsquo;ll you be
      free?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not until midnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw Ruthita listening, so I changed the subject. &ldquo;By the way, we met
      someone who knew you when you were a girl at Woadley. He wanted to be
      remembered to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her handsome face darkened. &ldquo;A man?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My cousin, Lord Halloway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She halted and looked round on me in proud astonishment. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she gasped,
      and renewed her calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruthita broke in to tell her of my good fortune. She did not pay much
      attention at first. Then it seemed to dawn on her. &ldquo;So he&rsquo;s out of it, and
      you&rsquo;ll be master at Woadley Hall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; I lowered my voice. &ldquo;And then you must come back to Woadley Ham.
      You were good to me once, Lilith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never forget.&rdquo; There was a look of the old kindness in her eyes as she
      said it. &ldquo;When you need me, I shall come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowd pressed about us, curious to overhear, surprised at seeing
      gentlefolks so chatty with a gipsy hussy. She signed to us to go. We drew
      off a few paces, looking on, recalling that night at Epping, when we fled
      from Dot-and-Carry-One and came to G&rsquo;liath&rsquo;s encampment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after that the clock of St. Nicholas boomed three, and we
      departed.

      CHAPTER IX&mdash;THE ELOPEMENT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>uthita was anxious
      to accompany me to the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you,&rdquo; I told her. &ldquo;Women always make a fuss over partings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not sensible women,&rdquo; she protested, smiling. &ldquo;Let me come. There&rsquo;s a
      dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll try to kiss me. You&rsquo;ll make a grab at my neck just as the train is
      moving. I shall feel embarrassed. You&rsquo;ll probably slip off the platform
      and get both your legs cut off. A nice memory to take with me to London!
      No, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t try to kiss you, and I won&rsquo;t grab at your neck. I&rsquo;ll be most
      careful about my legs. And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s nice of you to mention them
      so callously, Dante.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always tell folks,&rdquo; put in my grandmother, &ldquo;that, if there wer&rsquo;n&rsquo;t no
      partin&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;d be no meetin&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s just come and go in this life. If
      he don&rsquo;t want you, my dear, don&rsquo;t bother &rsquo;im.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he does want me,&rdquo; Ruthita persisted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always seen him off. I
      used to run beside the trap till I was ready to drop when Uncle Obad drove
      him away to the Red House. He&rsquo;s only making fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, really, Ruthie, I&rsquo;d much rather say good-by to you here in the shop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to catch the six-thirty-eight, you&rsquo;ll have to run,&rdquo; said
      my grandmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruthita looked hurt. She could not understand me. She felt that something
      was wrong. I picked up my bag. They hurriedly embraced and followed me out
      on to the pavement to watch me down the road. I looked back.
    </p>
    <p>
      There they stood waving and crying after me, &ldquo;Good-by. God bless you.
      Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In passing the chemist&rsquo;s shop I glanced in at the clock. It was five
      minutes faster than my watch. I turned into the High Street at something
      between a trot and a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering the station I saw that the London train was ready to depart.
      The guard had the flag in his hand and the whistle to his lips, about to
      give the signal. The porters were banging the doors of the carriages. I
      had yet to buy my ticket. Rushing to the office, I pushed my money
      through. &ldquo;&rsquo;Fraid you won&rsquo;t get the six-thirty-eight,&rdquo; said the
      clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reached the barrier, where the collector was standing, just as the guard
      blew his whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late,&rdquo; growled the collector, closing the gate in my face with all
      the impersonal incivility of a man whose action is supported by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lady and a little girl on board,&rdquo; I panted; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re expecting
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;should &rsquo;ave got &rsquo;ere sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the train began to move and I recognized the uselessness of
      further argument. As the tail of it vanished out of the station, the
      collector slid back the gate. Now that there was no danger of my
      disobeying him, he could afford to be human. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s h&rsquo;orders, yer know,
      sir, else I wouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; done it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Friends who had been seeing their travelers off came laughing and chatting
      toward the barrier. As the crowd thinned, half way down the platform I
      caught sight of Vi. She was standing apart, with her hand-baggage
      scattered beside her in disorder. Dorrie was hanging to her skirts,
      looking up into her face, asking questions. Neither of them saw me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hulloa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I spoke to her, Vi started. Her eyes brimmed. There shone through her
      tears a doubtful gladness. &ldquo;I thought&mdash;I thought you wer&rsquo;n&rsquo;t coming.
      I thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vi dearest! Was that likely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her fingers closed about my arm warningly as I called her dearest. She
      cast a scared look at Dorrie. &ldquo;Not before her,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shrugged my shoulders. The position was queer. For a man and a woman in
      our situation there was no readymade standard of conduct. I began to feel
      lost in the freedom we were making for ourselves. There were no landmarks.
      Even now we were beyond the conventional walls of right and wrong which
      divide society from the outcast. We were running away to seek our
      happiness&mdash;and we were taking Dorrie!
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to explain hurriedly how I happened to miss the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruthita wanted to come to the station. I lost time in dissuading her.
      When I got away, I discovered that my watch was slow by five minutes. And
      then to crown all, when I could have caught the train, the man at the
      gate...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; she said generously. &ldquo;How long before the next train
      starts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About half-an-hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do nearly as well. My boxes have gone on, but I can claim them in
      London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to stand in this stuffy station,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go for a
      walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began to speak, and then stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t&mdash;shan&rsquo;t we be recognized?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if we go round the harbor. We shan&rsquo;t be likely to meet anyone there
      who knows us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was odd, this keeping up of respectable appearances to the last.
      Ruthita, Grandmother Cardover, Sir Charles, my father&mdash;all the world
      would know to-morrow. They would spread their hands before their faces and
      look shocked, and peek out at us through their fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one ever thpeaks to me.&rdquo; Dorrie was reproachfully calling our
      attention to her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll both thpeak to you now,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Give me your hand, Dorrie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaving our baggage with a porter, we went out of the station to the
      harbor, which lay just across the station-yard. Vi manouvered herself to
      the other side of me, so that the child walked between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heavy autumn dusk was falling. Lanterns were being run up the masts.
      The town shone hospitably with street-lamps. Groping their way round the
      pier-head came a part of the Scotch herring fleet. We could see how their
      prows danced and nodded by the way the light from their lamps lengthened
      and shortened across the water. Soon the ripple against the piles near to
      where we were standing quickened with the disturbance caused by their
      advance. Then we heard the creaking of ropes against blocks as sails were
      lowered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning against the wall of the quay we watched them, casting furtive
      glances now and then at the illumined face of the station-clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorrie asked questions, to which we returned indifferent answers. It had
      begun to dawn on her that I was going up to London with them. She
      construed our secretiveness to mean that our plot was for her special
      benefit; people only acted like that with her when they were concealing
      something pleasant. Her innocent curiosity embarrassed us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why were we going to London? she asked us. We had not dared to answer that
      question even to one another. For my part I tried not to hear her; she
      roused doubts&mdash;phantoms of future consequence. I pictured the scene
      of long ago, when Ransby was rather more than twenty years younger, and
      another man and woman had slipped away unnoticed, daring the world for
      their love&rsquo;s preservation. Had they had these same thoughts&mdash;these
      hesitations and misgivings? Or had they gone out bravely to meet their
      destiny, reckless in their certainty of one another?
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind us, as we bent above the water, rose the shuffling clamor of
      numberless feet. Up and down the harbor groups of fisher-girls were
      sauntering abreast, in rows of three and four. Now and then we caught
      phrases in broad Scotch dialect.. They had been brought down from their
      homes in the north, many hundreds of them, for the kippering. They paraded
      bareheaded, with rough woolen shawls across their shoulders, knitting as
      they walked. I was thankful for them; they distracted attention from
      ourselves. Vi and I said nothing to one another; our hearts were too full
      for small-talk. The child was a barrier between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man halted near us. He had a heavy box on his back, covered with
      American-cloth. He set it down and became busy. In a short time he had
      lighted a lantern and hung it on a pole. He mounted a stool, from which he
      could command the crowd, raising the lamp aloft. Fisher-girls, still
      knitting, stopped in their sauntering and gathered round him. Several
      smacksmen and sailors, with pipes in their mouths, and hands deep in
      pockets, loitered up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man began to talk, at first at random, like a cheap-jack, trying to
      catch his hearers&rsquo; attention with a laugh. Then, when his audience was
      sufficiently interested, he unrolled a sheet upon which the words of a
      hymn were printed. He held it before him like a bill-board, so that all
      could see and the light fell on it. He sang the first verse himself in a
      strong, gusty baritone. One by one the crowd caught the air and joined in
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sang four verses, each verse followed by a chorus. The man allowed
      the sheet to drop, and handed the pole with the lantern to a bystander.
    </p>
    <p>
      His brows puckered. His eyes concentrated. His somewhat brutal jaw squared
      itself. His face had become impassioned and earnest all of a sudden. It
      had been coarse and rather stupid before; now a certain eagerness of
      purpose gave it sharpness. He began to talk with vehemence, making crude,
      forceful gestures, thrashing the air with his arms, bringing down his
      clenched right-fist into the open palm of his left-hand when a remark
      called for emphasis. His thick throat swelled above the red knotted
      handkerchief which took the place of a collar. He spoke with a kind of
      savage anger. He mauled his audience with brutal eloquence. His way of
      talking was ignorant. He was displeasing, yet compelling. There were
      fifteen minutes until the train started. I watched him with cynicism as a
      diversion from my thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brothers and sisters,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;we are &rsquo;ere met in the sight
      of h&rsquo;Almighty Gawd. It was &rsquo;im as brought us together. Yer didn&rsquo;t
      know that when yer started out this starlit h&rsquo;evenin&rsquo; for yer walk. It was
      &rsquo;im as sent me &rsquo;ere ter tell yer this evenin&rsquo; that the wages
      o&rsquo; sin is death. I know wot h&rsquo;I&rsquo;m a-saying of, for I was once a sinner.
      But blessed be Gawd, &rsquo;e &rsquo;as saved me and washed me white
      h&rsquo;in &rsquo;is son&rsquo;s precious blood. &rsquo;E can do that for you
      ter-night, an &rsquo;e sent me&rsquo;ere ter tell yer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some of the Cornish Methodists, in Ransby for the herring season, began to
      warm to the orator&rsquo;s enthusiasm. They urged him to further fervor by
      ejaculating texts and crying, &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed be &rsquo;is name!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory!&rdquo; etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man sank his voice from the roaring monotone in which he had started.
      &ldquo;The wages o&rsquo; sin is death,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Oh, my friends, h&rsquo;I speak as a
      dyin&rsquo; man to dyin&rsquo; men. Yer carn&rsquo;t h&rsquo;escape them wages nohow. The fool &rsquo;as
      said in &rsquo;is &rsquo;eart, &lsquo;There ain&rsquo;t no Gawd.&rsquo; &rsquo;Ave you
      said that? Wot&rsquo;ll yer say when yer &rsquo;ave ter take the wages? Now yer
      say, &lsquo;No one&rsquo;s lookin&rsquo;. They&rsquo;ll never find out. H&rsquo;everyone&rsquo;s as bad as I
      h&rsquo;am, only they doan&rsquo;t let me know it. I&rsquo;ll h&rsquo;injoy myself. There ain&rsquo;t no
      Gawd.&rsquo; I tells yer, my friends, yer wrong. &rsquo;E&rsquo;s a-watchin&rsquo; yer now,
      lookin&rsquo; down from them blessed stars. &rsquo;E looks inter yer &rsquo;eart
      and sees the sin yer a-meditatin&rsquo; and a-planning. &rsquo;E knows the
      wages yer&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave ter take for it. &rsquo;E sees the
      conserquences. And the conserquences is death. Death ter self-respec&rsquo;!
      Death ter &rsquo;uman h&rsquo;affection! Death ter the woman and children yer
      love! Death ter &rsquo;ope and purity! Damnation ter yer soul! &rsquo;Ave
      yer thought o&rsquo; that? Death! Death! Death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hissed the words, speaking slower and slower. His voice died away in an
      awestruck whisper. In the pause that followed, the quiet was broken by a
      shrill laugh. All heads turned. On the outskirts of the crowd stood &ldquo;Lady
      Halloway.&rdquo; She had evidently been drinking. A foolish smile played about
      her mouth. Her lips were swollen. She mimicked the evangelist in a hoarse,
      cracked voice, &ldquo;Death! Death! Death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I signed to Vi. Going first, carrying Dorrie in my arms, I commenced to
      force a passage. We had become wedged against the wall. Our going caused a
      ripple of disturbance. Attention was distracted from &ldquo;Lady Halloway&rdquo; to
      ourselves. She turned her glazed eyes on us. Stupid with drink, she did
      not recognize me at first. I had to pass beneath the lantern quite near
      her. As the light struck across my face, she saw who I was. &ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s
      got another gal,&rdquo; she tittered so all could hear her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy come and
      easy go-a. Love &rsquo;ere ter-day and thar ter-morrer. Good-evenin&rsquo;, Sir
      Dante Cardover, that is ter be. And &rsquo;oo&rsquo;s yer noo sweet-&rsquo;art? Is
      she as pretty h&rsquo;as me? Let a poor gal &rsquo;ave a look at &rsquo;er.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I pushed by her roughly. She would have followed, but some of the crowd
      restrained her. She made a grab at Vi. I could hear Vi&rsquo;s dress rending.
      &ldquo;So I ain&rsquo;t good &rsquo;nough!&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t good &rsquo;nough
      for yer! And &rsquo;oo are you ter despise me, I&rsquo;d like ter h&rsquo;arsk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said a lot more, but her voice was drowned in a protesting clamor. I
      turned my head as I crossed the station-yard. Beneath the evangelist&rsquo;s
      lantern I saw her arms tossing. Her hair had broken loose. Her eyes
      followed us. I entered the station and saw no more. Not until we had
      slipped through the barrier on to the platform did we slacken. Even while
      loathing her for her display of bestiality, my grandmother&rsquo;s words came
      back to me, &ldquo;She was as nice and kind a little girl as there was in
      Ransby, until that rascal, Lord Halloway, ruined her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We found that the porter, with whom we had left our luggage, had secured
      three seats for us. Two of them were corners. I took mine with my back to
      the engine, so that Vi and I sat facing one another. Dorrie sat beside Vi
      for a few minutes, uncomfortably, with her legs dangling. Then she slipped
      to the floor and climbing up my knees, snuggled herself down in my arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have fine timeth in London together, won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; she questioned.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tho glad you&rsquo;s toming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was strange how difficult I found it to speak to Vi. I wanted to say so
      much. I knew I ought to say something. Yet all I could think to mention
      was some reference to what had happened beside the harbor&mdash;and that
      was so contaminating that I wanted to forget it. Luckily, just then, an
      old countrywoman bundled in with a basket on her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gooing ter Lun&rsquo;non, me dear?&rdquo; she asked of Vi. &ldquo;Well, ter be sure, I
      intend ter goo ter Lun&rsquo;non some day. I get out at Beccles, the nex&rsquo; stop.&rdquo;
       Lowering her voice, &ldquo;That your little gal, and &rsquo;usband, bor? Not
      your &lsquo;usband! Well, &rsquo;e do seem fond o&rsquo; your little gal, now doan&rsquo;t
      &rsquo;e, just the same as if &rsquo;e wuz &rsquo;er father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The train began to move. The lights of Ransby flashed by, twinkling and
      growing smaller. We thundered across the bridge which separates the Broads
      from the harbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vi and the countrywoman were talking, or rather the countrywoman was
      talking and Vi was paying feigned attention. Dorrie, her flaxen curls
      falling across my shoulder, began to nod. Of the other passengers, one was
      drowsing and the other, a fierce be-whiskered little man, was reading a
      paper, leaning forward to catch the glimmering light which fell from the
      lamp in the center of the carriage. I was left alone with my thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were not pleasant. The religious commonsense of the man by the harbor
      disturbed me. The face of &ldquo;Lady Halloway&rdquo; proved the truth of his
      assertions. His words would not be silenced. Strident and accusing, they
      rose, above the rumbling of the train, and wove themselves into a
      maddening chorus: &ldquo;<i>The wages of sin is death; the wages of sin is
      death; the wages of sin is death</i>.&rdquo; A man whose intellect I despised,
      to whose opinions I should ordinarily pay no attention, had spoken truth&mdash;and
      I had heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Beccles the train stopped. The countrywoman alighted. The drowsy man
      woke up and followed her. The fierce little man curled himself up in his
      corner and spread his paper over his face to shut out the light. There
      were four hours more until we reached London. The train resumed its
      journey through the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dared not stir for fear of waking Dorrie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comfortable, Vi?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded and leant her face against the cushioned back of the carriage,
      closing her eyes. I watched her pure profile&mdash;the arched eyebrows,
      the heavy eyelids, the straight nose, the full and pouting mouth, the
      rounded chin, the long, sensuous curve of the graceful neck. I traced the
      small blue veins beneath the transparent whiteness of her temples. I
      studied her beauty, comihitting it to memory. Then I commenced to compare
      her with Dorrie, discovering the likeness. I wondered whether I had first
      felt drawn to her because she was so like Dorrie, or only for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked up from Dorrie, and found Vi gazing at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had thought her sleeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just wakened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been awake all the time. I&rsquo;ve been thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night. How different it was! We didn&rsquo;t have to hide. No one was
      looking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll go again to where no one is looking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t always do that. But I was thinking of something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pressed her cheek against the glass of the window, gazing out into the
      night. Then she leant over to me, clasping her hands. &ldquo;How cruel it was,
      what he said to us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man there in Ransby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t speak to us. He was one of those people who shout at
      street-corners because they like to hear their own voices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was speaking to me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;though he didn&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vi, you&rsquo;re not growing nervous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the word. I&rsquo;m looking forward and thinking how horrid it would
      be to have to hide always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at Dorrie, making no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she spoke again. &ldquo;Dante, have you ever thought of it? I&rsquo;m four
      years older than you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve never thought of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because four years makes a lot of difference in a woman. You&rsquo;ll look
      still young when I&rsquo;m turning forty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ignored my attempt to turn from the topic. &ldquo;If&mdash;if we should ever
      do anything rash, people would say that I was a scheming woman; that I&rsquo;d
      taken advantage of you; that, being the elder, I ought to have known
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The idea of Vi leading me astray was so supremely ridiculous that I
      laughed outright. Dorrie stirred, and gazed up in my face. &ldquo;Dear Dante!&rdquo;
       she muttered, and sank back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her father will be waiting for the cable,&rdquo; said Vi.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wondered if this was the kind of conversation my father and mother had
      carried on all those years ago when they ran away. I felt that if my arms
      were only free to place about her, all would be well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall have to tell him, Vi,&rdquo; I whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pretended not to hear me. Her eyes were closed. One hand shaded them
      from the light. She was again playing hide-and-seek with the purpose of
      our errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rumble of the wheels droned on. I planned for what I would do when the
      train reached London and the moment of decision should arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps two hours passed in silence. The glare of London was growing in
      the distance. Towns and houses became more frequent. One had glimpses of
      illumined windows and silhouettes against the blinds. Each house meant a
      problem as large to someone as mine was to me. The fact that life was so
      teeming and various robbed my crisis of its isolated augustness. Locals
      met us with a crash like thunder. As we flashed by, I could glance into
      their carriages and see men and women, all of whom, at some time in their
      existence, would decide just such problems of love and self-fulfilment&mdash;to
      each one of them the decision would seem vital to the universe, and in
      each case it would be relatively trivial. How easy to do what one liked
      unnoticed in such a crowded world! How preposterous that theory of the man
      by the harbor! As if any God could have time to follow the individual
      doings of such a host of cheese-mites!
    </p>
    <p>
      Our fellow-traveler in the corner woke and removed the paper from before
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wife tired?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a tedious journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was too much trouble to correct him as to our exact relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cleared the misty panes and looked out at a vanishing t station.
      &ldquo;Stratford. We&rsquo;ll be there in a quarter of an hour. Live in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. At least, sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He commenced to get his baggage together, keeping up his desultory volley
      of questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      We entered the last tunnel. I touched Vi&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re pulling into Liverpool Street. Do you want to claim your boxes
      to-night or to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      A porter jumped on the step of our carriage. Our fellow-traveler alighted,
      refusing his assistance. The man climbed in and, shouldering our luggage,
      inquired whether we wanted a cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned to Vi. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;ll we stay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slipped her arm through mine and drew me aside. The porter went
      forward to engage the cabby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me one more night alone with Dorrie,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Everything has
      been so&mdash;so hurried. You understand, dearest, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I helped her into the four-wheeler and lifted Dorrie after her. Having
      told the man to drive to the <i>Cecil</i>, I was about to enter. She
      checked me. &ldquo;We shall be able to get on all right.&rdquo; Then, in the darkness
      of the cab, her arms went passionately about my neck, and, all pretense
      abandoned, I felt her warm lips pressed against my mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the door banged Dorrie roused. Seeing me standing on the platform, she
      stretched her arms out of the window, crying, &ldquo;Oh, I fought you was toming
      wiv&rsquo; us, Dante.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to-night, darling,&rdquo; said Vi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; I promised her. Then to Vi, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be round at the <i>Cecil</i>
      shortly after ten. Will that do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. I watched them drive away, after which I jumped into a hansom
      and set off to pay Pope Lane a surprise visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not sleep that night; was making plans. The haste with which this
      step had been approached and taken had terrified Vi. I had been unwise.
      Her sensitiveness had been shocked by the raw way in which a desire takes
      shape in action. And the man by the harbor had upset her. I must get her
      away to a cottage in the country, where we could be alone, and where she
      would have time to grow accustomed to our altered relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, full of these arrangements, I sought her at the <i>Hotel
      Cecil</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not there; the office had no record of her. I remembered that her
      boxes had been left at Liverpool Street overnight. When I got there and
      made inquiries of the clerk, I found that the lady I described had been to
      the baggage-room an hour before me and had claimed them. After much
      difficulty I hunted out the cabman who had driven her. He showed me
      alcoholic sympathy, at once divining the irregularity of our relations,
      and told me that the lady had countermanded my orders and instructed him
      to drive her to the <i>Hotel Thackeray</i>. I arrived at the <i>Hotel
      Thackeray</i> in time to be informed that she had already left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four days later I received a letter which had been sent on from Ransby. It
      was from Vi, despatched with the pilot from the ship on which she was
      sailing to America.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not dared to see me again, she said. She was running away from the
      temptation to be selfish. She had reckoned up the price which her husband,
      Dorrie, and myself would have to pay that she might gain her happiness;
      she had no right to exact it. As far as her husband and Dorrie were
      concerned, if we had done what we had contemplated, we should have
      shattered something for them which we could never replace. She was going
      back to do her duty. That the task might not be made too difficult, she
      begged me not to write.

      CHAPTER X&mdash;PUPPETS OF DESIRE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> returned to
      Oxford. My rooms at Lazarus were in Fellows&rsquo; Quad&mdash;one was a big room
      in which I lived and worked, the other was a small bedroom leading out of
      it. My windows overlooked the smooth lawns and gravel paths of the college
      garden. Flowers were over, hanging crumpled and brown on their withered
      stalks. Here and there, a solitary late-blooming rose shone faintly. The
      garden stood upon the city-wall, overlooking the meadows of the Broad
      Walk. Every evening white mists from the river invaded it, billowing
      across the open spaces, breaking against the shrubs, climbing higher and
      higher, till the tops of the trees were covered. Sitting beside my fire I
      could hear the leaves rustle, and turning my head could see them falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ceiling of my living-room was low; the walls were paneled in white
      from bottom to top. The furniture was covered in warm red. The hearth was
      deep and the fender of polished steel, which reflected the glow of the
      coals when the day drew near its close. It was a room in which to sit
      quietly, to think, and to grow drowsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was October when I returned. Meadows were turning from green to
      ash-color. Virginia-creeper flared like scarlet flame against pale walls.
      The contented melancholy of the austere city was healing. It cured
      feverishness by turning one&rsquo;s thoughts away from the present. In its stoic
      calm it was like an old man&mdash;one who had grown indifferent to the
      world&rsquo;s changefulness. In healthy contrast to its ancientness was the
      exuberant youth of the undergrads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most grief arises from a thwarted sense of one&rsquo;s own importance. Here,
      among broken records of the past, the impermanence of physical existence
      was written plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Defaced hopes of the ages encountered one at every corner. Of all the men
      who had wrought here, nothing but the best of what they had thought stood
      fast; their personalities, the fashion of their daily lives were lost
      beneath the dust of decades. No place could have been found better in
      which to doctor a wounded heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the winter that followed Vi&rsquo;s departure, the new conception I had
      of her nobility upheld me. I could not sink beneath her standard of honor.
      When the temptation to write to her came over me, I shamed myself into
      setting it aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recognized now what would have been the inevitable penalty, had we
      followed our inclination that night. Only the madness of the moment could
      have blinded me to its result. We should have become persons cast off by
      society&mdash;insecure even in our claim on one another&rsquo;s affections,
      continually fleeing from the lean greyhound of remorse. Never for a day
      should we have been permitted to forget the irregularity of our relation.
      We should have been continually apologizing for our fault. We should have
      been continually hiding from curious, unfriendly eyes. The shame with
      which other people regarded us would have re-acted on our characters. And
      then there was Dorrie! She would have had to know one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had the man by the harbor and &ldquo;Lady Hallo way&rdquo; to thank for our escape.
      The strange combination of influences they had exerted at our hour of
      crisis, had saved us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black moments came when I gazed ahead into the vacant future. I must go
      through life without her. Unless some circumstance unforeseen should
      arise, we would never meet again. Then I felt that, to possess her, no
      price of disgrace would be too high to pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      I trained myself like an athlete to defeat the despair which such thoughts
      occasioned. I tried to banish her from my mind. In my conscious moments I
      succeeded by keeping myself occupied. But in sleep she came to me in all
      manner of intimate and forbidden ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      I crowded my hours with work that I might keep true to my purpose. And yet
      this method of fighting, when analyzed, consisted chiefly in running away.
      I took up tutorial duties at my college. I commenced to make studies for a
      biography of that typical genius of the Renaissance, half libertine, half
      mystic, Æneas Sylvius Piccolomini, known to history in his old age as Pope
      Pius IL I tried to fill up my leisure with new friendships. In none of
      these things could I become truly interested. My thoughts were crossing
      the ocean. When I was deepest in study I would start, hearing her voice,
      sharp and poignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon I was sitting with my chair drawn up to the hearth, my feet
      on the fender, a board across my knees, trying to write. A tap fell on the
      door. Lord Halloway entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a seat on the other side of the fireplace. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wanting to
      speak to you for some time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;wanting to explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wanting to explain what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Myself in general. You don&rsquo;t like me; I think you&rsquo;re mistaken. I&rsquo;m not
      the man I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should you explain to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see why you should. Woadley&rsquo;s probably coming to me&mdash;which you
      once thought was to be yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t worry me. I&rsquo;ll have the Lovegrove estates when my father
      dies. But I don&rsquo;t like to feel that any man despises me&mdash;it hampers a
      chap in trying to do right. You pass me in the quads with a nod, and hurry
      as you go by so that I shan&rsquo;t stop you. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want to know the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because of the woman they call &lsquo;Lady Halloway&rsquo; and all the other
      girls you&rsquo;ve ruined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it. That was why I wanted to tell you that I&rsquo;m done with that
      way of life. I was a colossal ass in the old days. But, you know, a good
      many fellows have been what I was, and they&rsquo;ve married, and settled down
      and become respected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what of the girls they&rsquo;ve ruined?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leant forward, clasping his hands and spreading his knees apart.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re blaming me for the injustices of society. Women have always had to
      suffer. But I&rsquo;ve always done the sportsmanlike thing by the girls I&rsquo;ve
      wronged. All of them are provided for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These things are your own affairs,&rdquo; I said shortly; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve always felt&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felt what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felt that the most disreputable thing about most prodigals is the method
      of their returning. They leave all the women they&rsquo;ve deceived and all
      their bastards in the Far Country with the swine and the husks, while they
      hobble home to forgiveness and luxury. Simply because they acknowledge the
      obvious&mdash;that they&rsquo;ve sinned and disgraced their fathers&mdash;they
      expect to escape the rewards of their profligacy. It&rsquo;s cheap, Halloway.
      You speak as though marriage will re-instate your morals. A man should be
      able to bring a clean record to the woman he marries.&rdquo; The off-hand manner
      in which he referred to his villainies had made me cold with a sense of
      justice. His lolling, fashionably attired person and his glib assertion
      that he had done with that way of life, roused my anger when I remembered
      his idiot son and the scene on the esplanade. He regarded me with a
      friendly man-of-the-world smile, pointing his delicate fingers one against
      the other. I would have liked him better had he shown resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make things hard,&rdquo; he objected. &ldquo;If everyone thought as you do,
      there&rsquo;d be no incentive for reformation. The man who had been a little
      wild would never be anything else. According to your way of thinking, he&rsquo;d
      be more estimable as a rake than as the father of a family. You shut the
      door against all coming back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke reasonably, trying to lift what had started as a personal attack,
      on to the impartial plane of a sociological discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the unfairness of it that irks me,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You tempt a girl and
      leave her to her disgrace. She bears both her own and your share of the
      scandal, while you scramble back into respectability. If you brought her
      back with you, I shouldn&rsquo;t object. But, after you&rsquo;ve persuaded her to go
      down into the pit, you draw up the ladder and walk away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave his high-pitched laugh. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how the world&rsquo;s made. It&rsquo;s none of
      my doing. If I married one of these girls, neither of us would be happy.
      One of these days I shall be Earl of Lovegrove. They&rsquo;re better as they
      are. You know that, surely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, why prevent me, when I&rsquo;m trying to get on to higher ground? I know
      I&rsquo;ve been a rotter. I&rsquo;ve made a mess of things. I don&rsquo;t need anyone to
      remind me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I held out my hand, saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been censorious. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this he dropped in often to see me. He was coaching the Lazarus
      toggers that autumn; his usual time for calling was between four and five,
      on his way up from the river. I got to know him well and to look for him.
      His big robustness and high color filled the student atmosphere of my room
      with an air of outdoor vitality. He was always cheerful. And yet I could
      not get away from the idea that he was making use of me for some
      undisclosed purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an egoist at heart&mdash;a charming egoist. Much of his
      conversation turned about himself. &ldquo;Now that you know me better, do you
      still think that I&rsquo;m barred from marriage?&rdquo; he would ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All kinds of people marry. It still seems unfair to me that, after
      knocking about the way you have, you should marry anyone who doesn&rsquo;t know
      the world pretty thoroughly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean I&rsquo;m tarnished and should marry a woman who is tarnished. You
      don&rsquo;t understand me, Cardover. My very knowledge of evil makes me worship
      feminine purity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was difficult to regard Lord Halloway as tarnished when you looked at
      his splendid body. His healthy physical handsomeness seemed an excuse for
      his transgressions. He upset all your ideas of the degrading influences of
      immorality.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Christmas I had Ruthita down to stay at Oxford. We were walking
      along the tow-path towards Iffley on the afternoon of her arrival, when
      the Lazarus Eight went by. Halloway was mounted, riding along the bank,
      shouting orders to the cox. As he passed us, he recognized Ruthita. I saw
      her color flame up. She halted abruptly, following him with her eyes round
      the bend of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we meet them again if we go on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told her we should be certain to meet them, as they would turn at Iffley
      Lock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to meet them.&rdquo; Then, in a whisper, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of him,
      Dante.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We retraced our steps to Folly Bridge and walked out to Hinksey to avoid
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an odd little creature, Ruthie. Why on earth should you be afraid
      of him? He can&rsquo;t do you any harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s his eyes. When he looks at me so hard, I forget all that I know
      about him, and begin to like him. And then, when he&rsquo;s gone, I come to
      myself and feel humiliated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now that I had found someone who would run him down, I changed sides and
      began to plead his cause. &ldquo;Seems to me it&rsquo;s a bit rough on the chap to
      remember his old faults. He&rsquo;s quite changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the woman at Ransby hasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she retorted bitterly. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t leave
      her a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was pleasant having Ruthita with me. I liked to hear the swish of her
      skirts as she walked, and to feel the light pressure of her hand upon my
      arm. She spoke with her face tilted up to mine. It was such a tiny face,
      so emotional and innocent. The frost in the air had brought a color to her
      cheeks and a luster to her hair. She loved to make me feel that she was my
      possession for the moment; I knew that I pleased her when I used her as
      though she were all mine. We treated one another with frank affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;you ever hear from Vi?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was awfully strange the way she left Ransby&mdash;so suddenly, without
      saying good-by. I had just one little note from her before she sailed;
      that was all. I&rsquo;ve written to her several times since then, but she&rsquo;s
      never answered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned the subject by saying, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this about Uncle Obad? Is he
      giving up the boarding-house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s going down into Surrey to raise fowls. He&rsquo;s already got his
      farm. Aunt Lavinia&rsquo;s wild about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where does he get his money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody knows, and he refuses to tell. Papa says that he must have found
      another Rapson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he isn&rsquo;t selling shares again, is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear no. He&rsquo;s become wonderfully independent, and says he doesn&rsquo;t need
      to make his poultry pay. It&rsquo;s just a hobby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old chap! I hope he doesn&rsquo;t come another cropper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says he can&rsquo;t, but he won&rsquo;t explain why. And d&rsquo;you know, I believe
      he&rsquo;s given Papa back the two thousand pounds that he lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it. What makes you think that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because Papa&rsquo;s stopped talking against him, and because I caught him
      looking up those guide-books to Italy again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We turned off from the Abingdon Road and curved round to the left through
      the sheep-farms of Hinksey. Hedges bristled bare on either side. Uplands
      rose bleak against the steely sky. Rutted lanes were brittle beneath our
      feet, crusted over here and there with ice. On thatched roofs of cottages
      sparrows squatted with ruffled feathers. Icicles hung down from spouts.
      The lambing season was just commencing. As we drew near farms the warm
      smell of sheep packed close together assailed our nostrils. From far and
      wide a constant, distressful bleating went up. Quickly and silently,
      rising out of the ground, dropping down from the sky, darkness closed in
      about us. In the cup of the valley, with the river sweeping round it, lay
      Oxford with its glistening towers and church spires. Little pin-points of
      fire sprang up, shining hard and frosty through the winter&rsquo;s shadows. They
      raced through the city, as though a hundred lamp-lighters had wakened at
      once and were making up for lost time. Soon the somber mass was a blazing
      jewel, flinging up a golden blur into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruthita hugged my arm. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it make you glad to be alive? I&rsquo;m never so
      happy as when I&rsquo;m alone with you, Dante. It isn&rsquo;t what we say that does
      it. It&rsquo;s just being near one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke like a child, groping after words, feeling far more than she
      could ever utter. But I knew what she meant. The woman in her was
      striving. Just as her flowerlike womanhood, unfolding itself to me
      secretly, made me hungry for Vi, so my masculinity stung her into wistful
      eagerness for a man&rsquo;s affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a queer little kiddie. What you need&rsquo;s a husband. I shall be
      frightfully jealous of him. At first I shall almost hate him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you hated him, I shouldn&rsquo;t marry him. Besides, I don&rsquo;t believe I shall
      ever marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We trudged back to Oxford in a gay mood, carrying on a bantering
      conversation. When we had entered Lazarus, I left her at the lodge,
      telling her to go to Fellows&rsquo; Quad while I ordered tea at the pantry. As I
      approached my rooms, I heard the sound of voices. Opening the door, I saw
      the lamp had not been lit. By the flare of the fire, I made out the
      profile of Ruthita as she leant back in the arm-chair, resting her feet on
      the fender. Standing up, looking down on her, with his arm against the
      mantelshelf was Lord Halloway.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced towards me in his careless fashion. &ldquo;This is quite the
      pleasantest thing that could have happened. I&rsquo;ve often thought about the
      drive to Woadley and wondered whether we three should ever meet all
      together again.&rdquo; Then, turning to Ruthita, &ldquo;Your brother&rsquo;s so secretive,
      Miss Cardover. He never breathed a word about your coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister&rsquo;s name is not Cardover,&rdquo; I corrected him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew himself to his full height languidly. &ldquo;I must apologize for having
      misnamed you, Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Favart,&rdquo; put in Ruthita.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it strange,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;that a brother and sister should be named
      differently?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I had another illustration of how he could draw out women&rsquo;s
      confidence. Ruthita had just run three miles in the opposite direction to
      avoid him, yet here she was eagerly telling him many things that were most
      intimate&mdash;all about her father and the Siege of Paris, and how I
      climbed the wall and discovered her, and how we had run off to get married
      and stayed with the gipsies in the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tea-boy came and set crumpets and muffins down by the hearth. I lit
      the lamp. Still they went on talking, referring to me occasionally, but
      paying little heed to my presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell began to toll for Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halloway rose. &ldquo;How long are you going to be in Oxford, Miss Favart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends on Dante, and how long he will have me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re staying a little while?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask, because I&rsquo;d like to take Cardover and yourself out driving. I have
      my horses in Oxford and you ought to see some of the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends on Dante.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk it over to-morrow,&rdquo; I said brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next few days, wherever we went we were unaccountably coming
      across Halloway. He always expressed surprise at meeting us, and always
      made himself delightful after we had met. If we walked out to Cumnor, or
      Sandford or Godstow, it made no difference in which direction, we were
      sure to hear the sharp trit-trotting of his tandem, and to see his high
      red dog-cart gaining on us above the hedges. Then he would rein up, with a
      display of amazed pleasure at these repeated accidents, and insist on our
      mounting beside him. Ruthita told me that she was annoyed at the way he
      broke up our privacy; but her annoyance was saved entirely for his
      absence. In his company she allowed him to absorb her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had accompanied Ruthita back to the <i>Mitre</i>, where she was staying.
      It was her last night. On returning to my rooms, I found Halloway waiting.
      I was surprised, for the hour was late. I noticed that his manner was
      unusually serious and pre-occupied for such an habitual trifler. When I
      had mixed him a whiskey and soda, I sat down and watched him. He tapped
      his teeth with his thumbnail.
    </p>
    <p>
      I grew restless. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Something on your mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know how to express it. You&rsquo;ve made it difficult for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the things you&rsquo;ve said from time to time. You see, it&rsquo;s this way.
      Until I met Miss Favart I was quite unashamed of myself. Her purity and
      goodness made me view myself in a new light. Since then I&rsquo;ve tried to
      retrieve my past to some extent. Of course, I can never be worthy of her,
      but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worthy of her! I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo; I leant forward in my chair,
      frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do understand,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;You must have guessed it from the
      first. I&rsquo;m in love with her and intend to make her my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Intend!&rdquo; I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose to his feet, as though willing to show me his fine body, and began
      to pace the room with the stealthy tread of a panther. He kept his eyes on
      mine. When he spoke there was a purring determination in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, intend. I&rsquo;ve always had my way with women. You&rsquo;ll see; I shan&rsquo;t fail
      this time. I may have to wait, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloway,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;re capable of realizing how
      decent people feel about you. Of course there are many men who disguise
      their feelings when they see you trying to do better. But very few of
      those same men would introduce you to their sisters, or daughters, or
      wives. To put it plainly, they&rsquo;d feel they were insulting them. So now you
      know how I feel about what you&rsquo;ve just told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused above me, looking down with an amused smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Cardover, that&rsquo;s just what I expected from you. You virgin men
      are so brutally honest where your ideals are concerned&mdash;so hopelessly
      evasive in facing up to realities. Don&rsquo;t you know that life <i>is</i> a
      coarse affair? I&rsquo;ve lived it naturally&mdash;most strong men have at some
      time. I&rsquo;ve been open in what I&rsquo;ve done. Everybody knows the worst there is
      to know about me. Most men do these things in secret. I couldn&rsquo;t be secret
      and preserve my self-respect. Skeletons in the cupboard ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t much in my
      line. Ruthita knows me at my wickedest now; when she knows me at my best,
      she&rsquo;ll love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When my sister marries,&rdquo; I said coldly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be to a man who can bring
      her something better than the dregs of his debaucheries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave his foolish laugh. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a new name for the Lovegrove titles.
      I&rsquo;d better be going. If I stay longer, you may make me angry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rose to see him take his departure. He had passed out and gone a few
      steps down the passage, when I heard him returning. The door just opened
      wide enough for him to look in on me. &ldquo;My dear Cardover,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I came
      back to remind you of another of those evasive realities. You know, she
      isn&rsquo;t your sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A week later I received an indignant letter from Ruthita, saying that Lord
      Halloway had been to Pope Lane to see my father, and had asked for her
      hand in marriage. She had refused even to see him. By the same mail came a
      letter from the Snow Lady, couched in milder terms and asking for
      information. She wanted to know whether Halloway was as black as he was
      painted. I referred her to Ruthita, telling her to ask her to describe
      what happened on the esplanade. As a result I received a final letter,
      agreeing with me that the matter was impossible, but at the same time
      enlarging on the wealth and prestige of the Lovegrove earldom.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a fortnight I refused to have anything to do with my cousin, but his
      imperturbable good-humor made rancor impossible. In the cabined intimacies
      of college life a quarrel was awkward. To the aristocratic much is
      forgiven; moreover he was a splendid all-round athlete and one of the
      hardest riders to hounds that the &lsquo;Varsity had ever had. So he was popular
      with dons and undergraduates alike. One morning when he stopped me in
      Merton Street, offering me his hand, I took it, agreeing to renew his
      acquaintance. My commonsense told me that the defeated party had most
      cause for grievance. His sporting lack of bitterness sent him up in my
      estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spring broke late on the world that year in a foam of flowers. Like a
      swollen tide it swept through our valley in wanton riot and stormed across
      the walls of our gray old town. It surged into shadowy cloisters and
      dashed up in spray of may-blossom and lilac. Every tree was crested with
      the flying foam of its hurry. The Broad Walk, leading down to the barges,
      was white with blown bloom of chestnuts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quadrangles became gay with geraniums. Through open windows music and
      men&rsquo;s laughter sounded. Flanneled figures, carrying rackets and
      cricket-bats, shot hither and thither on bicycles. At evening, in the
      streets beneath college windows, groups of strolling minstrels strummed on
      banjos and sang. Fresh-faced girls, sweethearts and sisters of the
      undergraduates, drifted up and down our monastic by-ways, smiling eagerly
      into their escort&rsquo;s eyes, leaving behind them ripples of excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      All live things were mating. The instinct for love was in the air. My
      longing for Vi was quickened. The sight of girls&rsquo; faces filled me with
      poignancy. Every beauty of sound, or sight, or fragrance became
      commemorative of her. By day I traced her resemblance in the features of
      strangers. Inflamed desire wove tapestries of passion on the canvas of the
      night. Roaming through lanes of the countryside, I would meet young lovers
      in secluded places, and flee from them in a tempest of envy. Had she sent
      me one little sign that she still cared, I would have abandoned everything
      and have gone to claim her. My mind was burning. I poured out my heart to
      her in letters which, instead of sending, I destroyed. I became afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halloway was in the same plight. He never mentioned Ruthita; but he would
      come to my room, and pause before her photograph and fall silent. However,
      he knew how to shuffle his fortune to convenience his environment. He had
      his comforters. Gorgeous young females fluttered in and out of his
      apartments, like painted butterflies. His only discretion was in the
      numbers of his choice. They might have been the daughters of dukes by
      their appearance, but you knew they were chorus-girls from London. One day
      when I questioned him, he threw me a cynical smile, saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying
      the expulsive power of a new affection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The phrase took root. If I was to do the honorable thing by Vi, I also
      must employ my heart in a new direction. The thing was easy to say, but it
      seemed impossible that I should ever be attracted by another woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had become my habit to spend much of my time sitting by the open window
      of my room, gazing out into the college garden. Hyacinths, tulips,
      crocuses bubbled up from beneath the turf. Every day brought a change. In
      the spring breeze the garden tossed and nodded, applauding its own
      endeavor. Songsters had returned to their last year&rsquo;s nests. From morn to
      dusk they caroled in the shrubberies. Twittering their love-songs or
      trailing straws, they flashed across gulfs which separated the chestnuts.
      Over Bagley Wood, as I sat at work, I could hear the cuckoo calling. From
      the unseen river came the shouting of coaches to their crews, and the long
      and regular roll of oars as they turned in their rowlocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I glanced up from my books one evening. The glow of sunset, hovered along
      the city-wall. Leaning over its edge, looking down into the meadows, a
      tall girl was standing. Her back was towards me. She was dressed in the
      palest green. Her hair was auburn. She held her skirt daringly high,
      disclosing the daintiest of ankles. Her open-work stockings were also of
      green to match the rest of her attire. Her companion was Brookins, the
      assistant chaplain, an effeminate little man, who was known among the
      undergraduates as the doe-priest. He seemed ill at ease; she was
      manifestly flirting with him. In the stillness of the garden the
      penetrating cadence of her gay voice reached me. It was friendly, and had
      the lazy caressing quality of a summer&rsquo;s afternoon when bees are humming
      in and out of flowers. I was tantalized by a haunting memory. She turned
      her face part way towards me. I caught her mocking profile. The way the
      red-gold curls fell across her forehead was familiar; and yet I could not
      remember. She came along the terrace, walking in long, slow, undulating
      strides. The west shone full upon her. She was brilliant and gracious, and
      carried herself with an air of challenging pride. Her tall, slim figure
      broke into exquisite lines as she walked, revealing its shapely frailty.
      Her narrow face, with its arch expression of innocence, promised a
      personality full of secrets and disguises.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stepped across the sill of my window into the garden. They were near
      enough now for me to catch an occasional word of their conversation. I
      approached across the lawn towards them. She glanced in my direction
      casually; then she steadied her gaze. I saw that her eyes were green,
      specked with gold about the iris. She stooped her head, still gazing at
      me, and asked a question of the doe-priest in a lowered voice. I heard him
      speak my name. A bubbling laugh sprang from her lips. She came tripping
      towards me with her hand extended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to pretend you don&rsquo;t know me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do know you, and yet I can&rsquo;t recall where we have met or what is your
      name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you ever in Sneard&rsquo;s garden at the Red House?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiesole Cortona, and you&rsquo;re Dante.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We stood there holding one another&rsquo;s hands, searching one another&rsquo;s faces
      and laughing gladly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well I never!&rdquo; I kept repeating. &ldquo;Fancy meeting you after all these
      years!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I much changed?&rdquo; she questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re more beautiful,&rdquo; I said boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded her head roguishly. &ldquo;I can see you&rsquo;re no longer afraid of
      girls. You were once, you remember.&rdquo; The doe-priest had stood by watching
      us nervously. It was plain that Fiesole had scared him&mdash;he was glad
      to be relieved of her. The bell in the tower began to toll for dinner.
      Brookins jangled his keys, edging towards the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Mr. Brookins, are you hungry? Must you be going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to be late at high table, Miss Cortona,&rdquo; he replied stiffly.
      &ldquo;The Warden is very particular about punctuality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, Brookins,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look after Miss Cortona. You cut
      along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brookins made his farewells with more alacrity than politeness. Fiesole
      gazed after his departing figure with mischievous merriment in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thinks me a dangerous person,&rdquo; she pouted. &ldquo;He thinks I was luring him
      on to be naughty. He&rsquo;ll go and preach a sermon about me. He&rsquo;s bristling
      with righteousness. And now that he&rsquo;s managed to escape, he&rsquo;s locking poor
      innocent you, Dante, all alone in the garden with the wicked temptress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather like it. Besides, I know a way out&mdash;over there, through my
      window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As we strolled across the lawn I asked her, &ldquo;Where, under the sun, did you
      pick up Brookins? He doesn&rsquo;t seem just your sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I picked him up at Aix-les-Bains. He was sowing his wild oats
      imaginatively and eyeing the ladies in <i>La Villa des Fleurs</i>. He was
      trying to find out what it felt like to be truly devilish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t sound like Brookins. I suppose he was gathering experience,
      so that he might be able to deal understanding with erring undergrads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re charitable. At any rate, when I met him he was playing the truant
      from morality. I was in the Casino.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What doing? Gambling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;You see I was nearly as bad as Mr. Brookins. He came and
      stood behind my chair while I was playing. When I got up and went out into
      the garden, he followed. It was all dusky and dimly lit with faery-lamps.
      I suppose it made him feel romantic. I saw what he was doing out of the
      corner of my eye; so, for the fun of it, I tried to fascinate him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll warrant you did. It was the old game you played with me and the
      Bantam. You take delight in making other people uncomfortable. It&rsquo;s the
      most adventurous thing about you, Fiesole. You&rsquo;ve got the name of a
      lullaby and the manners of a mustard-plaster. You&rsquo;ll be trying to sting me
      presently, when you catch me sleepy and unaware.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not you, Dante.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke my name coaxingly, veiling her eyes with her long lashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you did once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I? So you still remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was unwilling to be sentimental. &ldquo;What did you do next to poor
      Brookins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took up the thread of her story with feigned demureness. &ldquo;I chose out
      a bench well hidden in the shadows. He came and seated himself on the edge
      of it, as far away as he could get from me. He cleared his throat several
      times. I could hear him moistening his lips. Then he whispered, almost
      turning his back on me, &lsquo;Je vous aime.&rsquo; And I whispered, turning my back
      on him, &lsquo;Do you? Now isn&rsquo;t that lovely!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then, finding I was English, he became more comfy. He began to boast
      about Oxford and mentioned Lazarus. So I thought to-day the least I could
      do was to call on him. I didn&rsquo;t know he was a parson. You should have seen
      his face when he saw me. I&rsquo;ve been getting even with him all this
      afternoon. He thinks I&rsquo;ve risen out of the buried past to haunt him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She broke into low musical laughter, shaking her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were cruel, Fiesole. What he said to you was the sum total of the
      intent of his wickedness. He had reached the limit of his daring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it. That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t like him. He isn&rsquo;t thorough. He told me
      that his name was Jordan at Aix. When I asked for him at the lodge to-day,
      the porter said there weren&rsquo;t no sich purson. I was turning away, when I
      saw him coming across quad in full clericals, walking by the side of a
      stooping old gentleman shaped like the letter C.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be the Warden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, was it? Well, he didn&rsquo;t see me and was walking right by me. I tapped
      him on the arm and said, &lsquo;Good-afternoon, Mr. Jordan.&rsquo; He paled to his
      lips and stared. The old gentleman raised his hat to me and said, &lsquo;This is
      Mr. Brookins, not Mr. Jordan, my dear young lady. You must be mistaken.&rsquo;
      &lsquo;Jordan&rsquo;s my pet name for him,&rsquo; I answered. The old gentleman smiled, and
      smiled again and left us. Then I turned to Mr. Brookins and said, &lsquo;Je vous
      aime. Be sure your sins will find you out.&rsquo; After that I tried to be very
      nice to him, but somehow I couldn&rsquo;t make him happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not surprised. Brookins was wondering how he could explain to the
      Warden not knowing a charming young lady, who had a pet name for him.
      They&rsquo;re asking him about it now at the high-table, and he&rsquo;s lying fit to
      shame the devil. His pillow will be drenched to-night with tears of
      penitence. You rehearsed the Judgment Day to him. You&rsquo;ve turned the tables
      on him, because, you know, that&rsquo;s his profession every Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I helped her to step across the sill of my window. She gazed round my
      room, taking in the pipes and tobacco-ash and clothes strewn about. &ldquo;I
      love it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so cosy and mannish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She perched herself on the arm of a chair, so that the golden, after-glow
      fell athwart her. I watched her, thinking how little she had changed from
      the old Fiesole. She was still tantalizing, as mischievous as a
      school-girl; once she had fiddled with boys&rsquo; heartstrings, now she took
      her pastime in breaking men&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a creature of vivid mysteries, alternately wooing and repelling.
      She could beckon you on with passionate white arms and thrust you from her
      with hands of ice. She came out of nowhere like a wild thing from a wood.
      You looked up and saw her&mdash;she vanished. She courted capture and
      invited pursuit; but you knew that, though you caught her, you would never
      tame her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had plucked a deep-cupped daffodil from a vase on the table. She was
      bending over it with a tender air of contemplation. She held the long slim
      stalk low down in her dainty, long, slim fingers. The golden dust of the
      petals seemed the reflection of the golden glint that was in her hair. The
      stalk was the color of her eyes. Her tempestuous loveliness&mdash;made to
      lure and torture men, to fill them with cravings which she could not
      satisfy&mdash;was resting now.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at me with calculated suddenness. She read admiration in my
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You find me pretty nice, don&rsquo;t you, Dante?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not disguising it, am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought, maybe, you were cross with me about Brookins. We never quite
      approved of one another, did we, Dante? You thought and still think me a
      coquette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With some people, but not with you. I only played with the Bantam to draw
      you out of your shell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the absurdity of being serious over an affair of childhood struck us
      and we went off into gales of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be sensible,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What are you doing? Staying at Oxford with
      friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m traveling alone with my maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any engagement for this evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why shouldn&rsquo;t we spend it together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No reason in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;ll we spend it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t spend it here, just you and I. The college doesn&rsquo;t allow it.
      Besides, you haven&rsquo;t had dinner. Where&rsquo;ll we dine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say to punting down to Sandford and dinner at the inn there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As we passed through the quads, men were coming out of Hall from dinner.
      Some of them went thundering up wooden-stairs to their rooms, tearing off
      their gowns. Others strolled arm-in-arm joking and conversing, smoking
      cigarettes. At sight of Fiesole, they hauled up sharply. She was a man&rsquo;s
      woman, and they were struck by her beauty. With one accord they turned
      unobstrusively and hurried their steps towards the lodge, to catch one
      more glimpse of her face as she passed out. She betrayed no sign that she
      was aware of the sensation she was creating. She advanced beside me with
      eyes modestly lowered, enhancing her allurement with a serene air of
      innocence. Out in the street her manner changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The men do that always,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and, do you know, I rather like them
      for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do they do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stare after me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wonder Brookins was shocked by you, Fiesole. You&rsquo;re a very shocking
      person. You say the most alarming things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laid her hand on my arm for a second. &ldquo;But I say them charmingly.
      Don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On our way through the meadows to the barges, I asked her what she had
      been doing all these years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a time I tried the stage, but lately I&rsquo;ve been traveling in Europe. I
      have no relations&mdash;nothing to keep me tethered. I roam from place to
      place with my maid, moving on and on again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the kind of woman who marries. Men like me, but when it comes to
      making me their wife, it&rsquo;s &lsquo;Oh no, thank you.&rsquo; They want a woman a little
      more stupid. Are you married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shot me a penetrating glance. &ldquo;Engaged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;m aware of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We came to the Lazarus barge. I piled cushions in a punt for her. She lay
      with her back to the prow, so that she faced me. I took the pole and
      pushed off into midstream.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had the river to ourselves; its restful loneliness caused us to fall
      silent. We left the barges quickly; then we drifted slowly. Fields were
      growing white and vaporous. The air was damp, and cool, and earthy. Behind
      us the spires of Oxford shone like a clump of spears against the
      embattled, orange-tinted sky. Before us, swimming in blue haze, was Iffley
      Mill. Everything was becoming ill-defined&mdash;receding into nothingness.
      Far away across meadows to the right we caught sounds of gritting hoofs
      and the grinding of a wagon. Sometimes a bird uttered one long fluty cry.
      Sometimes a swallow swooped near us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dante, all the others have passed on, and there&rsquo;s only you and I. What&rsquo;s
      happened to the Bantam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married in Canada. He&rsquo;s farming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you thought you loved me in the old days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could tell you some things to prove it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t do much to prove it at the time. You were a terribly shy and
      stubborn boy. You left me to do all the courting. I&rsquo;ve often laughed at
      the things I did to try and make you kiss me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that was what I was wanting most to do all the time. D&rsquo;you know what
      sent me to the infirmary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I told her how I had crept out of bed and out of doors in the middle
      of the night to visit the summer-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a little beast I was,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always being a little beast,
      Dante. That&rsquo;s the way I&rsquo;m made. Can&rsquo;t help it. But I&rsquo;ll never be like that
      to you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the time we got to Sandford it was night. Lamps in the inn were
      lighted, shining through the trees across the river. We had dinner in the
      room next to the bar, in an atmosphere of beer and sawdust and tobacco.
      The windows were open; the singing of water across the weir was
      accompaniment to our conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told me the beginning of many things about herself with a strange
      mixture of frankness and restraint. She spoke of the early days in Italy
      before her parents died, and of the ordered quiet of her convent life at
      Tours. After her expulsion from the Red House she had returned to France,
      and fallen in with the artistic set that had been her father&rsquo;s in Paris.
      Her guardian, an old actor, had persuaded her to train for the stage. For
      a time she had succeeded, but had dropped her profession to go traveling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an amateur at living,&rdquo; she told me; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always chopping and
      changing. I&rsquo;ll find what I want some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her restlessness had carried her into many strange places. Northern Africa
      was known to her; she had been through India and Persia. Speaking in her
      lazy voice, with the faintest trace of a foreign accent, she painted
      pictures of sun-baked deserts with caravans of nodding camels; of decayed,
      oriental cities sprawled out like bleached bones in palm-groves beside
      some ancient river-bank; of strange fierce rituals in musty temples,
      demanding the blood-sacrifice. She made me feel while she spoke how
      narrowly I had lived my life. Like a fly on a window-pane I had crawled
      back and forth, back and forth, viewing the adventure of the great
      outside, rebellious at restraint, but never taking any rational measures
      for escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The river droned across the weir. In the bar-room next door glasses
      clinked; yokels&rsquo; voices rose and fell hoarsely in argument. Fiesole came
      to a halt and leant back in her chair, gazing searchingly into my face
      across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look queer, Dante. What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed shortly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been putting the telescope to my eye. You&rsquo;ve
      been making me see things largely. How was it that you broke loose that
      way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a horror of growing stodgy. I was born to be a South Sea Islander
      and to run about naked in the sunshine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long are you to be in Oxford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve made no plans. I hadn&rsquo;t expected to spend more than one
      night. But now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not finish the sentence. We rose from the table. In the porch we
      loitered, breathing in the deep, cool stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay a little while, won&rsquo;t you, Fiesole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took my arm and smiled. &ldquo;Of course&mdash;if you want me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Going down through the arbors, we stepped into the punt The river was
      a-silver with moonlight.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI&mdash;SPRING WEATHER
    </h2>
    <p>
      I drugged myself with Fiesole to avoid thinking of Vi. Fiesole was so
      vivid in her personality that, while she was present, she absorbed my
      whole attention and shut out memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a continual source of pleasure and surprise, for her mood was
      forever changing. She could be as naughty as a French novel and as solemn
      as the Church of England Prayer Book. When she tried to be both together
      she was at her drollest; it was like Handel played on a mouth-organ.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would never let me take her seriously. There lay the safety of our
      comradeship. At the first hint of sentiment, she flew like a hare before a
      greyhound; the way she showed her alarm was by converting what should have
      been pathos into absurdity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day after day of memorable beauty I spent with her in that blowy Cotswold
      country. We would usually appoint our place of meeting somewhere on the
      outskirts of Oxford. It was not necessary to let everyone know just how
      much of our time was lived together. This care for public opinion lent our
      actions the zest of indiscretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I set out to meet her, I would pass crowds of undergrads, capped and
      gowned, sauntering off to their morning lectures. I was playing truant,
      and that gave an added spice to adventure. Each college doorway frowned on
      my frivolity, calling me back to a sense of duty. But the young foliage
      glittered and the spring wind romped down the street, and the shadows
      quivered and jumped aside as the sunlight splashed them. The lure of the
      feminine beckoned. Where the houses grew wider apart I would find her, and
      we would commence our climb out of the valley. Now we would come to a
      farm-house, standing gray and mediaeval in a sea of tossing green. Now we
      would pass by flowery orchards, smoking with scattered bloom. Brooks
      tinkled; birds sang; across the hedge a plowman called to his horses and
      started them up a new furrow. And through all this commotion of new-found
      life and clamorous hearts we two wandered, glad in one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the atmosphere of what we talked about remains with me. There were
      moments when we skirted the seashore of affection, and perhaps pushed out
      from land a little way, speculating on love&rsquo;s audacities and dangers. But
      these moments were rare, for Fiesole delighted in love&rsquo;s pursuit and not
      in its certainty. We made no pretense that our attraction for one another
      was more than friendly and temporary. If we played occasionally at being
      lovers, it was understood that we were only playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiesole never admitted that she had prolonged her stay in Oxford for my
      sake. She kept me in constant attendance by the threat that this might be
      my last chance of being with her. The supposition that her visit was
      shortly to end gave us the excuse we needed for being always together. We
      lived the hours which we shared intensely, as friends do who must soon go
      their separate ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      But beneath her veneer of wit and frivolity I began to discover a truer
      and kinder Fiesole. These flashes of self-revelation came when she was off
      her guard. They were betrayed by a tremor in her tone or a hesitancy in
      her gaiety. After a day of exquisite sensations, her independence would
      break down and the fear of loneliness would look out from her eyes. She
      would prolong her departure, again postponing it beyond the date
      appointed. I began to suspect that her dashing recklessness was a barrier
      of habit, which she had erected to defend her shyness from curious
      observers. Insincerity was a cloak for her sincerity. Hidden behind her
      tantalizing lightness lay the deep and urgent feminine desire for a man
      and little children. I had roused in her the mating instinct. I was not
      the man; she had yet to find him. With myself the same thing was true. I
      took delight in her partly for herself, but mainly as Vi&rsquo;s proxy. Fiesole
      and I had come together in a moment of crisis. We saw in each other the
      shadow of what we desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a month had gone by I began to debate with myself how far our conduct
      was safe and justifiable. I went so far as to ask myself the question, did
      I want to marry her. But that consideration was impossible in my state of
      mind. Besides, as Fiesole herself had said, she was the type of woman that
      a man may love and yet fear to marry. She had no sense of moral
      responsibility. She would demand too much of herself and her lover. Her
      passion, once aroused, would burn too ardently. It would be
      self-consuming. She was a wild thing of the wood, swift and beautiful, and
      un-moral.
    </p>
    <p>
      May had slipped by. June was nearly ended. Still she delayed. A chance
      remark of Brookins brought me to my senses and forced me to face the
      impression we had created. Fiesole, when she visited me in college,
      invariably brought her maid; we would shut her up in my bedroom while we
      sat in my study. In this way, we supposed, appearances had been saved. But
      Brookins&rsquo;s remark proved the contrary&mdash;that he hoped I&rsquo;d let him know
      when I moved out of Lazarus as he&rsquo;d like to have my rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not moving out of Lazarus. What made you think that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to when you&rsquo;re married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what makes you think that I&rsquo;m going to be married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to think,&rdquo; he tittered. &ldquo;We only have to use our eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That decided me. In common fairness we must separate. Since I could not
      make the suggestion to her, I determined to leave Oxford myself. The term
      was nearly ended. My work on the Renaissance furnished an excuse for a
      visit to Italy. I had never been out of England as yet; at Pope Lane we
      had had all we could do to keep up a plausible appearance of stay-at-home
      respectability. But Fiesole with her talk of travel, had led me to peep
      out of the back-door of the world. I made up my mind to start immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a golden summer&rsquo;s evening. How well I remember it! I had not seen
      her for two days. I was finishing my packing. A trunk stood in the middle
      of the floor partly filled. Over the backs of chairs clothes hung
      disorderly. Piles of books lay muddled about the carpet, among socks and
      shirts and underwear. Through the open window from the garden drifted in
      the rumor of voices and the perfume of roses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened without warning. I was kneeling beside the trunk. Glancing
      over my shoulder I saw her. She slipped into the room like a ray of
      sunlight, and stood behind me. She wore a golden dress, gathered in at the
      waist with a girdle of silver. Her arms, bare from the elbow, hung looped
      before her with the fingers knotted.
    </p>
    <p>
      I glanced at her a moment. Her face was pale with reproach. Her
      rebelliousness had departed. Her lips trembled. She looked like a
      sensitive child, trying not to cry when her feelings had been wounded.
      This was the true Fiesole I had long suspected, but had never before
      discovered. We had no use for polite explanations; in the past two months
      we had lived too near together. She knew what it all meant&mdash;the
      half-filled trunk, the scattered clothing, the piles of books. Feeling
      ashamed, with a hurried greeting I turned back to my packing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke in a low voice, with a tremble in it. It filled me with panic
      desire to be kind to her; yet I dared not trust myself. I did not love
      her. I kept telling myself that I did not love her. My whole mind and
      being were pledged to another woman. And yet pity is so near to love that
      I could not allow myself to touch her. I was mad from the restraint I had
      suffered. To touch her might result in irreparable folly. Kneeling lower
      over my trunk, I shifted articles hither and thither, pressed them closer,
      moved them back to their original places, doing nothing useful, simply
      trying to keep my hands busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched me. I could not see her, but I felt that behind my back the
      slow, sweet, lazy smile was curling up the corners of her mouth. I knew
      just how she was looking&mdash;how the eyebrows were twitching and
      nostrils panting, the long white throat was working. I fixed my mind upon
      Vi. I was doing this for her. Maybe, if Fiesole had come first, we might
      have married. But we should not have been happy. I must be true to Vi, I
      told myself. I was like a man parched with thirst in a burning desert, who
      sees arise a mirage of green waters and blue palm-trees&mdash;and knows it
      to be a mirage, and yet is tempted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were going away without telling me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice broke. I listened for the sob, but it did not follow. Outside in
      the garden a thrush awoke; his notes fell like flashing silver, gleaming
      dimmer and dimmer as they sank into the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were going away because of me. I would have gone if you had spoken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still kneeling, I looked up at her. &ldquo;Fiesole, I didn&rsquo;t dare to tell you.
      Something was said. We had to separate. I thought this way was best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Said about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can guess. They said you were in love with me. Was that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I tried to rise, but she held me down with her hands upon my shoulders.
      Each time I bent back my head to answer, she stooped lower above me. Her
      breath was in my hair. The gold flashed up in the depths of her eyes. Her
      voice broke into slow laughter. With her lips touching my forehead she
      whispered, &ldquo;And what if they did say it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment we gazed at one another. I hoped and I dreaded. By one slight
      action of assent, the quiver of an eye-lid or the raising of a hand, I
      would thrust Vi from me forever. A marriage with Fiesole would at least be
      correct&mdash;approved by society; but I should have to sin against Vi to
      get it&mdash;to sin against a love which was half-sinful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiesole straightened. The tension relaxed. She placed her hand on my head,
      ruffling my hair. As though imitating the thrush, a peal of silver
      laughter fell from her lips. &ldquo;Oh, Dante, Dante! You are just as you were.
      You&rsquo;re still afraid of girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rose to my feet. She was again a coquette, rash, luring attack, but
      always on the defensive. I gained control of myself as my pity ebbed. I
      had been mistaken in thinking I had hurt her. I should have known she was
      play-acting. And yet I doubted.
    </p>
    <p>
      We walked over to the lounge by the window. I seated myself beside her,
      confident now of my power to restrain myself. &ldquo;I was afraid for you&mdash;not
      of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you be afraid for me when I&rsquo;m not afraid for myself? No,
      Dante, it wasn&rsquo;t that. You&rsquo;re afraid of yourself. Someone told you long,
      long ago, when you were quite little, that it was naughty to flirt. You&rsquo;ve
      never forgotten it, and each time you begin to feel a bit happy you
      believe you&rsquo;re going to do something bad. So you&rsquo;ve put your heart to bed,
      and you&rsquo;ve locked the door, and you&rsquo;ve drawn the curtains. You play nurse
      to it, and every time it stirs, you tiptoe to the door to see that the key
      is turned, and to the windows to see that they&rsquo;re properly bolted. I&rsquo;ll
      tell you what&rsquo;s the matter with you, Dante. I stole along the passage and
      hammered on the door of your heart&rsquo;s bedroom, and your heart half-roused
      and called, &lsquo;Nurse.&rsquo; There!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw herself back against the cushions, seizing both my hands in
      hers. She gazed at me unflinchingly, daringly, mockingly. She drew me to
      her and thrust me from her with quick sharp jerks. She treated the
      situation so lightheartedly, so theatrically, that I could have kissed her
      with impunity. But it would have been like kissing the statue of a woman.
      She would have remained unmoved, unresponsive. There would have been no
      adventure of conquest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Miss Impudence,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re wrong. I wish sometimes my heart
      were safe in bed. You and I have been good friends. You came to me at a
      time when I most needed you. You never guessed the good you were doing. If
      this hadn&rsquo;t happened, I would never have told you. But when I heard
      something said about you, which no girl would like to have said unless it
      were true, I thought it was time I should be going. You&rsquo;ve been so good to
      me that I couldn&rsquo;t return your good with evil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear, I daresay I&rsquo;ve flirted with half-a-hun-dred men. It&rsquo;s very
      nice of you to think I haven&rsquo;t, and to be so careful of me. But really it
      doesn&rsquo;t matter what anybody says. I don&rsquo;t want you to run away because of
      that, just when we were having such a good time together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t let me be serious,&rdquo; I protested. &ldquo;Now I want you to imagine for
      a minute that I&rsquo;m old, and inoffensive, and have white hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, and about seventy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About seventy-five I should say&mdash;I&rsquo;ve known some pretty lively men
      of seventy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. About seventy-five. I&rsquo;m imagining.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear girl, you&rsquo;re twenty-four or thereabouts, and you&rsquo;re extremely
      beautiful. No man can look at you without being fascinated. I&rsquo;ve often
      wanted to kiss you myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiesole, you&rsquo;re not playing the game,&rdquo; I said sternly. &ldquo;Please go on
      imagining.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m imagining.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I was saying, you&rsquo;re extremely fascinating. Everything&rsquo;s in your favor
      for making a happy and successful marriage, except one thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no parents. Now parents are a kind of passport. Seeing that you
      haven&rsquo;t any, you&rsquo;ve got to be more circumspect than other girls. It has
      come to my ears that for the past two months you&rsquo;ve been seen every day
      with one young gentleman. People are beginning to talk about it. Since you
      don&rsquo;t intend to marry him, you ought to drop him until you are married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who says I don&rsquo;t intend to marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took me by the shoulders and drew me to her. The afterglow had faded
      from the garden. I could not see her face distinctly, but it seemed to me
      that that old expression of hungry wistfulness was coming back. I heard
      men enter the room overhead. A bar of light, like a golden streamer,
      fluttered and fell across the lawn. A piano struck up, playing <i>Mr.
      Dooley</i>. The dusk was humanized and robbed of its austerity. Her hands
      trembled on my shoulders. For a second time I doubted the genuineness of
      her playacting. I hurried on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you did want to marry him it would make no difference. He&rsquo;s
      pledged to another woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hands fell away. When she spoke it was gravely and with effort. &ldquo;You
      didn&rsquo;t tell me. You said you weren&rsquo;t engaged when I asked you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither am I, nor likely to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The silence was broken by her taking my hand. She took it with a sudden
      gesture and, bowing her head, kissed it. &ldquo;Poor Dante,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose from the sofa and lit the lamp. Kneeling by my trunk, I
      blunderingly recommenced my packing. From the window came a muffled,
      choking sound. Perhaps she was trying not to sob. I had never seen her so
      gentle as just now. My mind ran back over the long road we had traveled.
      The Fiesole I had seen was a wild, mad girl, provoking, charming,
      inconsiderate as a child and frolicsome as the mad spring weather&mdash;but
      rarely tender. I wondered what other secrets of kindness lay hidden in her
      personality. She was the sort of woman a man might live with for twenty
      years and still be discovering. She kept one restless by the very richness
      of her character. It was true what she had said: many men might love her;
      few would desire to marry her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose from the lounge. Standing between me and the lamp, her long
      shadow fell across me. I looked up and saw that her lashes glistened.
      Against the background of the white-paneled room she looked supremely
      lovely&mdash;a tall, gold daffodil. She held her head high on her splendid
      shoulders with a gesture of proud despair. And yet an appearance of
      meekness clothed her. Her face had an expression which a young girl&rsquo;s
      often has, but which hers had seldom&mdash;an expression which was
      maternal. She watched my clumsy attempts to squeeze my clothes into
      smaller compass. Then she came and knelt beside me, saying, &ldquo;Let me do
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her swift white hands plied back and forth, re-arranging, smoothing out
      with deft touches, reaching out for socks to fill the hollows, rectifying
      my awkwardness. The thought flashed on me that this sensation I had was
      one of the sacred things of marriage&mdash;a man&rsquo;s dependence on a woman.
      As I watched, I imagined the future, if this woman should become a wife to
      me. But the passion for her was not in me. She was only an emotion. The
      sight of her made me hungrier, but not for her. I reasoned with myself,
      saying how many men would desire her. I forced myself to notice the curve
      of her neck, the way the red-gold curls clustered about her shell-like
      ears and broad white forehead. I told myself that the best solution for Vi
      would be that I leave her unembarrassed by marrying Fiesole. But the more
      I urged matters, the colder grew my emotions. Then my emotions ceased and
      my observations became entirely mental.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overhead, strident and uproarious, as if striving to burlesque what should
      have been chivalrous, the piano thumped and banged; men&rsquo;s voices smote the
      night like hammer-strokes on steel, singing,

      Mr. Dooley&mdash;-ooley&mdash;&mdash;-ooley&mdash;&mdash;-oo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; she said. Then, &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Italy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My country. When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll write me sometimes? I shall be lonely, you know, at first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if you&rsquo;re going to write to me, I must write to you. You&rsquo;ll have to
      let me have your addresses so that I can send my letters on ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wrote her out the list of towns and dates, telling her to address me <i>poste
      restante</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I accompanied her across the quad to the lodge. I had had no idea it was
      so late. Big Tom had ceased ringing for an hour. It was past ten. The
      porter, when I called him out to unlock the gate, eyed us disapprovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you home,&rdquo; I told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated, urged that she could get home quite safely by herself, it
      was such a short way to go&mdash;but at last she surrendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the mysterious, moon-washed streets we walked; but not near
      together as formerly. We had nothing to say to one another. Or was it that
      we had too much, and they were things that we were ashamed to utter? The
      echo of our footfall followed behind us like a presence. At the turnings
      we lost it. Then it seemed to hurry till it had made up the distance;
      again it followed. The cobble-stones beneath us made our steps uneven.
      Sometimes we just brushed shoulders, and started apart with a guilty sense
      of contact. Sometimes we passed a window that was lighted by a student&rsquo;s
      lamp. We could see him through the curtains poring over outspread books,
      holding his head between his hands. As we turned to look in on him, our
      faces were illumined. Her face was troubled; coming out of the night
      suddenly it looked blanched and distressful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The air became heavy with the perfume of laburnums. It occurred to me that
      the laburnum was the flower with which she was best compared. It burned,
      and blazed, and fell unwithered. In crossing Magdalene Bridge we caught
      the sighing of willows along the banks of the Cherwell. I had often
      thought how restful was the sound. To-night I marveled at myself; it
      seemed poignant with anguish, like a fretful heart stirring. Under the
      bridge as we crossed, a punt slipped ghostlike down stream; the subdued
      laughter of a girl and the muffled pleading of a man&rsquo;s voice reached us.
      Then memory assailed me. &ldquo;They are even as you and I, Fiesole,&rdquo; my heart
      whispered, &ldquo;even as you and I once were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I fell to wondering, as I caught the moon shining through the lace-work
      parapet of Magdalene tower, how many such love-affairs of lightness it had
      seen commenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door of the house in which she lodged we halted abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this is the end,&rdquo; she said. Then, feigning cheerfulness, she ran up
      the steps, crying, &ldquo;Good luck to you on your journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the pavement I called to her, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, I&rsquo;ve kept you out late, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door banged.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had had much to say to her. Now that she was gone the thoughts and words
      bayed in my brain like bloodhounds. There were apologies, excuses,
      explanations&mdash;kind, meaningless phrases, which would have held a
      meaning of comfort for her. It was too late now. For a moment her shadow
      fell across the blind; then her arm was raised and the light went out.

      CHAPTER XII&mdash;THE BACK-DOOR OF THE WORLD
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Englishman is
      brought up to live his life independently of woman. He considers his
      masculine solitariness a sign of strength. To be seen in the streets with
      his wife or sisters is to acknowledge that they are necessary. He feels
      awkward at being observed publicly in their company. He shows them no
      gallantries. He walks a little way apart. His conversation with them lacks
      spontaneity. He is not enjoying himself. He is wanting to be kind and
      natural, but he dreads lest he should be thought effeminate. His national
      conception of manliness demands that he should be complete in himself. How
      he ever so forgets his shyness as to make a woman his wife is one of the
      unsolved mysteries. Some primeval instinct, deeper than his national
      training of reserve, goads him to it. On recovering from his madness, he
      is among the first to marvel.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Christian had climbed to the top of the hill his sack of sins fell
      from his back. When an Englishman lands in France, he drops his bundle of
      moral scruples in the harbor as he passes down the gang-plank. For
      morality is a matter of temperament, and for the time being his
      temperament shall be French. Just as a soul newly departed, may look back
      with pitying resentment on the chill chaotic body that once confined it,
      so he looks back across the English Channel at the uncharming rectitude of
      his former self. Being an Englishman has bored him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall never forget the first wild rapture with which I viewed the tall
      white cliffs of Dieppe. It was about three in the afternoon. The sky was
      intensely blue, dotted here and there with fleecy islands of cloud. The
      sun smote down so hotly on the deck that one&rsquo;s feet felt swollen. Far away
      the gleaming quaintness of the French fishing-town grew up and stole
      nearer. It seemed to me that as the wind swept towards us from the land, I
      caught the merry frou-frou of ten thousand skirts. Fields and woodlands
      which topped the cliffs, hid laughing eyes and emotional white arms
      eagerly extended. The staccato chatter of happiness lay before me. I had
      escaped from the Eveless Paradise of my own countrymen. I had slipped out
      by the back-door of the world. I was free to act as I liked. I was
      unobserved. Discretion had lost its most obvious purpose. It excited me to
      pretend to myself that I was almost willing to be tempted.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night I sat by the quays at Rouen, observing the groups of men and
      women, always together, passing up and down. I saw how they drew frankly
      near to one another. I listened to their scraps of quiet conversation. The
      lazy laughter, now the hoarse brass of men&rsquo;s voices, now the silver
      clearness of a woman&rsquo;s, rose and fell. Below me barges from Paris creaked
      against the piles, and the golden Seine swept beneath the bridges, singing
      like a gay grisette. As night sank down I was stung to loneliness,
      thinking of the absence of Vi and Fiesole.
    </p>
    <p>
      I arrived in Paris on the evening of the following day. Hastily depositing
      my baggage at my hotel in the Rue St. Honoré, I set out to stroll the
      boulevards. Until three in the morning I wandered from café to café. I
      searched the faces of passers-by for signs of the gracious abandon to
      happiness of which I had so often heard. My mind teemed with vivid images
      of pleasure such as crowd the pages of novels concerning Paris. Flitting
      moth-like up and down garish tunnels of light I saw a painted death. It
      simpered at me from under shadows of austere churches. It flirted with me,
      ogling me with slanted eyes, as I passed beneath the glare of lamps. I
      crossed the Pont St. Michel going southward, and found it in the guise of
      girls masquerading in male attire. I went across the bridges again and
      found it in the Rue de Rivoli, hunting with jaded feverish expression for
      men. Wherever I went I encountered the same fixed mercenary smile, saw the
      same lavish display of ankles beneath foamy skirts, and heard the same
      weary tip-tapping of feet which carried bodies which should be sold to
      whoever would purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where was the joy and adventure of which I had heard? The purpose of
      happiness should be life, not death. Several times that night women turned
      aside and seated themselves at a table beside me. They roused my pity;
      pity was quickly changed to disgust by their hot-foot avarice. All around
      me was a painted death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overhead the breeze ruffled the tree-tops. I looked up through the leaves.
      Stars were going out. I caught between roofs of tired houses a glimpse of
      the Eternal looking down. Surely the God who kept the wind going and
      replenished the sky with clouds, meant man to be happy in some better
      fashion. I went back to my hotel and, gathering together my baggage, fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Florence the problem of right and wrong presented itself to me in
      another aspect. Restraint seemed attended with sadness; license with
      ugliness and regret. From above dim shrines disfigured Christs bespoke the
      anguish of crucified passions. On the other hand, Filippino&rsquo;s tattered <i>Magdalene</i>
      symbolized the hideous rewards of abandonment. Both restraint and
      unrestraint brought sorrow, and I wanted to be supremely glad. Life should
      be an affair of singing. I was fascinated by the thought of woman. With
      one woman I was in love; in another I was interested. Both of them I must
      forget. I would not love Fiesole because I could not marry Vi. Yet within
      me was this capacity for passion, smoldering, leaping, expanding, fighting
      for an outlet. Surely in a rightly governed world it should find some fine
      expression! Through the by-ways of every city that I entered the lean
      hound of vice hunted after nightfall, and behind him stalked the painted
      death. The cleanness of the country called me. Like a captive stag, I
      longed to feel the cool touch of leaves against my shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Accademia at Florence I discovered my own dilemma portrayed. It
      stated my problem, but it offered no solution. However, it gave me a sense
      of comradeship to find that Botticelli, so many years ago, had peered down
      over the same precipice. In <i>The Kingdom of Venus</i> one sees a
      flowered wood; from leafy trees hangs golden fruit; between their trunks
      drifts in the flaming light that never was on sea or land. Here a band of
      maidens have met with a solitary youth to celebrate the renewal of spring.
      In the center of the landscape, a little back from the group, stands a
      sad-faced Venus, who might equally well be a madonna listening for the
      dreadful beat of Gabriel&rsquo;s wings who shall summon her to be mother of a
      saviour to the world. To her left stand three wanton spirits of earth and
      air, innocently carnal, eternal in their loveliness. To her right three
      maidens dance with lifted hands. One of them gazes with melancholy desire
      towards the youth. He looks away from her unwillingly. In their eyes
      broods the gloomy foreknowledge of wrong-doing. They would fain be
      Grecians, but they have bowed to the Vatican. The shadows, the flowers,
      the rustling leaves are still pagan; but in the young girl&rsquo;s eyes hangs
      the memory of the tortured Christ. She is wanton in her scarcely veiled
      nakedness, but she dares not forget; and while she remembers, she cannot
      be happy. The lips with which she will woo her lover have worshiped the
      wound-prints of the pierced hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Renaissance made even its sadness exquisite by using it as the vehicle
      for poetry; but we, having lost our sense of magic, explain our melancholy
      in mediaeval terms. Magic was still in the world; I was determined to find
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was continually drawn back to the picture. I would sit before it for
      hours. It explained nothing. If offered no suggestions. It simply told me
      what I already knew about myself. But in watching it I found rest.
      Rebellion against social facts which turn love into lust left me. I came
      to see that a love which is unlawful is only lovely in its unfulfilment.
      The young girl in the woodland, did she rouse the frenzy in her lover,
      would lose the purity which was irrecoverable; by evening she would weep
      among the broken flowers. Perhaps, did I win her, it might be so with Vi.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to find satisfaction by losing myself in memories of the past. The
      past is always kindlier than the present because, as Carlyle once said,
      the fear has gone out of it. The heavy actuality of the sorrows of Romeos
      makes them pleasurable romance only to latter-day observers. In their own
      day they were scandals. So I wandered through sun-scorched Italian towns,
      red and white and saffron, and I hung above ancient bridges, looking down
      on rushing mountain torrents, and I dreamt myself back to the glory of the
      loves that had once been self-consuming beneath that forgetful hard blue
      sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came to Ferrara my mind was stormy with thoughts of Lucrezia Borgia&mdash;Lucrezia
      of the amber hair. It was here that she came in her pageantry of shame to
      seek her third husband in the unwilling Alphonso. Ferrara had not changed
      since that day. She had seen it as I saw it. I entered the town at sunset.
      The golden light smote against the red-brick walls of the Castello. I
      imagined that I saw her sweet wronged face, half-saint, half-siren, gazing
      out from the narrow barred windows across the green-scummed moat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hired rooms in the primitive <i>Pellegrino e Gaiana</i>. They looked out
      on the dusty tree-shadowed Piazza Torquato Tasso, where tables with white
      cloths were spread, on which stood tall bottles of rough country wine. I
      promised myself that from there, as I sat, I could just discern the
      Castello. I had my dinner beneath the trees. On the further side of the
      square was a wine tavern. Men and girls were singing there. Sometimes the
      door would push open, letting out a rush of light. I tried to think that
      they were the men-at-arms of long ago. A cool breeze stirred the dust at
      my feet. The moon was rising. I got up and sauntered through gaunt paved
      streets, past empty palaces, past Ariosto&rsquo;s house and out toward the
      country, where vines hung heavy with grapes, festooning the olivetrees.
      Italy lay languorous and scented in the night, like a fair deep-bosomed
      courtesan. The sensuous delight of the present mingled with my thoughts of
      the past. I had been hardly surprised had Lucrezia stolen out from the
      dusk towards me, with the breeze whipping about her the golden snakes of
      her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly I turned back to the town. At the Castello I halted, peering across
      the moat at the sullen darkness of the walls on the other side. As I stood
      smoking my cigar, I saw an English girl coming towards me across the
      Piazza Savonarola. Her nationality was unmistakable; she walked with a
      healthy air of self-reliance which you do not find in Latin women. I was
      surprised to see her. July is not the month for tourists. So far, save for
      a few Americans, I had had Italy to myself. And I was surprised for
      another reason&mdash;she was unaccompanied.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she drew nearer, I turned my back so that she should not be offended by
      my staring. I heard her step coming closer. It halted at my side. I looked
      round, supposing she had lost her direction and was about to question me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you here!&rdquo; I exclaimed and remained staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d expect me,&rdquo; she laughed shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I didn&rsquo;t. How should I? What brought you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was on my way to Venice; but remembering you were here, I stayed over
      for the night. You don&rsquo;t mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind! I should say not. Where are you staying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the <i>Albergo Europa</i>. I was just on my way over to the <i>Pellegrino
      e Gaiana</i> to inquire if you were there. I&rsquo;ve asked at all the other
      hotels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While we had been speaking I had been watching her closely. What was it
      that was changed in her? Was it the voluptuousness of the Italian night
      that made her more splendidly feminine? She had lost her laughing tone of
      laziness. Her beauty was strong wine and fire. Something had become
      earnest in her. Then I asked myself why had she come&mdash;was she really
      on her way to Venice?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m jolly glad you came,&rdquo; I said impetuously; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been missing you ever
      since I left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took my arm, giving it a friendly hug, just as Ruthita did when she
      was glad. We walked over to the Piazza Torquato Tasso. Seating ourselves
      at a table beneath the trees, we called for wine. The light from the
      trattoria fell softly on her face. The air was dreamy with fragrance of
      limes. At tables nearby other men and women were sitting. Across the way
      in the tavern my men-at-arms were still singing and carousing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you thinking?&rdquo; she asked, leaning across towards me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking that I now begin to understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; She jerked the question out. It was as though she had flung
      up her arms to ward off a blow. Her voice panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve always puzzled me,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You are a mixture of ice and fire.
      The ice is English and the fire is Italian. You&rsquo;re different to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re mediaeval. The fire has melted the ice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took my hand gratefully and drew me nearer. &ldquo;Do you like me better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much better. I keep thinking how like you are to Simonetta in The <i>Kingdom
      of Venus</i>. I spent hours sitting before it at the Accademia in
      Florence. I couldn&rsquo;t tell what was the attraction. Now I know. It was you
      I was looking at; you as you are now&mdash;not as you were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dante,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you can see what is beautiful in a painting or a poem,
      but you can&rsquo;t see beauty in things themselves. You&rsquo;re afraid to&mdash;you&rsquo;re
      afraid of being disillusioned. You see life as reflected in a mirror.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s safer,&rdquo; I smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took me up sharply. There was pain in what she said. &ldquo;Ah, yes, safer!
      You&rsquo;re always counting the cost and looking ahead for sorrow. You&rsquo;re a
      pagan, but fear makes you an ascetic. You have the feeling that joy is
      something stolen, and you grow timid lest you&rsquo;re going to be bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you believe,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;that anything that makes two people
      happy must be right and best?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that anything that makes them sad must be wicked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiesole,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;have you been sad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She would not answer, but drew herself back into the shadow so I could not
      see her expression. We sat silent, fingering our glasses, giving ourselves
      over to the languor of the summer&rsquo;s night. Through the rapturous stillness
      we heard the breeze from the mountains rustling across the Emilian plain
      like a woman in silk attire. At a neighboring table a man and a girl,
      thinking themselves unobserved, swayed slowly towards one another and
      kissed, as though constrained by some power stronger than themselves.
      Through the golden windows of the tavern across the way, one could see the
      silhouettes of men and women trail stealthily across the white-washed
      walls. The spirit of Lucrezia and her lover-poets seemed to haunt Ferrara
      that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to Venice,&rdquo; I said abruptly. &ldquo;So am I. Perhaps we shall meet
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might travel there together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We rose from the table. It was late. The piazza was growing empty. The
      apple-green shutters before the windows of the houses were closed. Behind
      some of them were lights which threw gold bars on the pavement. The
      streets were silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know that I would be here?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget&mdash;you left me your addresses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I did. But you didn&rsquo;t write. Why didn&rsquo;t you write?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid you wouldn&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What she meant by that I could only guess. Perhaps she hardly knew
      herself. My blood was rushing wildly through my veins. I was breathing the
      atmosphere of passion. I did not look ahead; I was absorbed in the
      present. I had been hungry for Vi&mdash;well, now I had Fiesole. I had
      been thirsty for the love of a woman. Fiesole was giving me her
      comradeship. I was intoxicated with life&rsquo;s beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The saffron moon looked down, pillowed on a bank of silver cloud. As we
      passed the Castello, a fish leapt in the moat, and fell back with a
      splash. I halted, leaning against the parapet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it was here we met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pressed against me. I could feel the wild beating of her heart; it
      tapped against my side, calling to my heart for entrance. Her voice shook
      with emotion; it whispered above the surge of conflicting thoughts like
      the solemn tolling of a sunken bell. &ldquo;Since then everything has become
      golden, somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I dared not trust myself to respond to her tenderness. I was shaken and
      awed by her intensity. With her lips just a little way from mine, so that
      my cheeks were fanned by her breath, her face looked into mine, the chin
      tilted and the long white throat stretched back. I gazed on her
      motionless, with my arms strained down against my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiesole,&rdquo; I whispered, &ldquo;how many girls and boys have stood here and said
      that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eagerness died out. She slipped her arm into mine. &ldquo;But we are alive.
      I was thinking of nobody but our two selves to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We plunged into the cool deep shadows of the colonnade. We turned into the
      Corso della Giovecca. Down the long dim street all the houses stood in
      darkness, save for a faint patch of light which carpeted the pavement in
      front of her hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your maid will be wondering what has happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me curiously. &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t. I didn&rsquo;t bring her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night until to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked back once from the doorway and smiled She entered. The sleepy
      porter came out and swung to the gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was amazed at her bewitching indiscretion. For myself it did not matter.
      But what of her, if we should be seen together? A man can afford such
      accidents; but a woman&mdash;&mdash; I tried to deceive myself. Our
      meeting was, as she had said, haphazard. We were both alone in Italy. Our
      routes lay in the same direction. What more natural than that we should
      travel together? But I knew that this was not the case. I determined to
      open her eyes to the risks she was taking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning when I woke, I wondered vaguely what was the cause of this
      strange elation. Then memory came back. I jumped out of bed and flung the
      shutters wide. Out in the piazza some earlier risers were already seated
      at the tables. A man was watering the pavement, singing gaily to himself.
      Beneath the trees a parrot and a cockatoo screeched, hurling insults at
      one another from their perches. A soldier showed his teeth and laughed,
      talking to a broad-hipped peasant girl. At the top of the piazza a slim
      white figure waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made haste with my dressing. I was extremely happy. I tried to analyze
      the situation, but lost patience with myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Picking up my hat and running down the stairs, I came across her standing
      outside the Cathedral, in the full glare of the sun. Before I had spoken
      she turned, darting like a pigeon, instinctively aware of my approach.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve beaten you by nearly two hours,&rdquo; she called gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      We passed into the fruit-market. I bought a basket of ripe figs; sitting
      down on a bench we ate them together. All round us was stir and bustle.
      Farmers in their broad straw-hats were unyoking oxen while women spread
      the wares.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiesole, there&rsquo;s just one thing I want to say to you, after which I&rsquo;ll
      never mention it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what it is. I&rsquo;ve thought it all out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure you have? Of course no one may ever know. But if by some
      chance they should find out, are you sure that you think it&rsquo;s worth
      while?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckoning the cost again!&rdquo; she laughed, helping herself to another fig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay gladly. It&rsquo;s you I&rsquo;m considering,&rdquo; I said seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rested her hand on mine. It was cool, and long, and delicate. I was
      startled at the thrill it gave me. &ldquo;Dante,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;have you ever
      wanted anything so badly that your whole body ached to get it? When you
      were very thirsty, say, and you heard a stream, singing &lsquo;Find me. Find me&rsquo;
      out of sight in the hills among the heather? Then you climbed up and up,
      and the sun beat down, and your throat was dry, and the stream sang
      louder, and at last you found it. I&rsquo;m like that. I don&rsquo;t mind what the
      bank is like. I lie down full-length and let the water sing against my
      mouth. I&rsquo;ve been thirsty for something, Dante, all my life. Yes, I&rsquo;ve
      counted the price. If you don&rsquo;t mind having me, Dannie, I&rsquo;ll stay with you
      for the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rubbed her cheek against my shoulder ever so slightly. I bent towards
      her. When you&rsquo;ve wounded a woman, there&rsquo;s only one way of making
      recompense. She saw my intent. She drew back laughing, dragging my hand
      with her. The quick red blood mounted to her forehead. The gold in her
      green eyes sparkled with gladness. &ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; she cried. Then recovering
      herself, &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re a dear to want me like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That morning we visited the Corpus Domini where Lu-crezia Borgia lies
      buried. We were admitted to a little chapel where all was lonely and
      silent. Presently a door opened and two nuns dressed in black entered.
      Their faces were covered from sight by long black veils. All that was
      human we were permitted to see of them was their eyes, which looked out
      from two black holes like stars in a dreary night. They had been beautiful
      perhaps, but because Christ was crucified they had crucified themselves.
      And these women, who had never tasted life, whose flesh had never throbbed
      with the sweet torture which was their right, whose bodies were the
      unremembered sepulchres of little children whose lips had never pressed
      the breast&mdash;these women were the guardians of her who had been the
      Magdalene of the Renaissance, whose feet had climbed the Calvary of
      passion, but not the Calvary of sacrifice. Sunlight, amber-colored as
      Lucrezia&rsquo;s hair, slipped across the slab which marked her grave. Down
      there in the unbroken dusk, did her tresses mock decay?
    </p>
    <p>
      From a hidden cloister the chanting of children&rsquo;s voices broke the quiet.
      Its very suddenness took me by the throat. It was the future calling out
      of the sad and molder-ing content of stupidly misspent lives. Fiesole
      edged her hand into mine. I smiled into her eyes; then I looked at the
      nuns again. Who would remember them when three centuries had gone by?
      Lucrezia, if she had been wanton, had at least given joy; so the world
      forgave her now that she was buried. We tiptoed out into the tawny street,
      where water tinkled down the gutters. We had found a new sanction for
      desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was towards evening that we sighted Venice, floating between sea and
      sky in a tepid light. Where we parted from the mainland, thin trees ran
      down to the water&rsquo;s edge, shivering and gleaming, like naked boys. As the
      train thundered across the trestled bridge which spans the lagoon, Fiesole
      and I crowded against the window, tingling with excitement. The salt wind
      smote upon our faces and loosened a strand of her red-brown hair.
      Laughing, I fastened it into place. She snatched up my hand and kissed the
      fingers separately. We were children, so thrilled with happiness that we
      could speak only by signs and exclamations. A gondola drifted by, rowed by
      a poppe in a scarlet sash. Though we both saw it, we cried to one another
      that it was a gondola, and waved. Then the gold sun fell splashing through
      the clouds; Venice was stained to orange, and the lagoon to the purple of
      wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not until the train had halted in the station did it occur to me that we
      had made no plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hotel porters were already fighting to get possession of our baggage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going to stay?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wherever you like,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A good place is the <i>Hotel D&rsquo;Angleterre</i>
      on the Riva degli Schiavoni.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So she took it for granted that we should put up at the same hotel! We
      went aboard the steamer and traveled down the Grand Canal in prosaic
      fashion, with the nodding black swans of gondolas all about us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Hotel D&rsquo;Angleterre</i> stands facing the Canale di San Marco,
      looking across to San Maria della Salute. The angle is that from which so
      many of Canaletto&rsquo;s Venetian masterpieces were painted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proprietor came out to greet us suave and smiling. &ldquo;A room for
      Monsieur and Madame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two rooms,&rdquo; I said shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we went upstairs to look at them, we found that they were next door
      to one another. Fiesole made no objection.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were both front rooms and faced the Canal. One could hardly find
      fault with them on the ground that they were too near together.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time dinner was over the silver dusk was falling. A hundred yards
      out two barche, a little distance separated, drifted with swinging
      lanterns. The tinkling of guitars sounded and the impassioned singing of a
      girl. Above embattled roofs of palaces to the westward fiery panthers of
      the sunset crouched. The beauty of it all was stinging&mdash;it seemed the
      misty fabric of a dream which must instantly shatter and fade into a pale
      and torturing remembrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stepped into a gondola.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke a few hasty words in Italian, then we stole out from the quay
      across the velvet blackness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; I asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Round the old canals of the Rialto.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon every sound, even the faint sounds of Venice, grew fainter and
      vanished. Only the dip of the oar was heard, the water lapping, and the
      weird plaintive cry of the poppe as we approached a corner, &ldquo;A-ôel,&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Sia stali&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sia premi&rdquo; as we turned. We crept along old waterways
      where the oozy walls ground against the gondola on either side. Far, far
      up the narrow ribbon of ink-blue sky and the twinkling of stars looked
      down. Fiesole cuddled against me, like a contented tired child. I kept
      thinking of what she had said, &ldquo;Have you ever wanted anything so badly
      that your whole body ached to get it?&rdquo; I wondered if she had got that
      something now.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we returned to the hotel it was past midnight. The sharp tang of
      morning was in the air. Lights which had blazed across the lagoon, now
      smoldered like torches burnt to the socket. Venice floated, a fair Ophelia
      with eyes drowned and hair disordered; one saw her mistily as through
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our gondola creaked against the landing, banged by the little waves. A
      poppe in a nearby barca groaned in his sleep and stirred. We were cramped
      with our long sitting. I gave Fiesole my arm; she shrank against me. At
      the door of her room I paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had one brilliant day to remember. You&rsquo;re happy now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very happy, dear Dante.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I entered my room and sat down in the dark on the side of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not love her. I blundered my way over all the old arguments. I told
      myself that, since I could not marry Vi, I could not do better than marry
      Fiesole. But at the thought my soul rebelled&mdash;it was treachery. I
      tried to expel Vi&rsquo;s image from my mind, but it refused to be expelled. I
      lived over again all the intoxicating pleasure of the day, but it was Vi
      who was my companion. I only drugged myself with Fiesole. She appealed to
      my imagination; her loveliness went like a strong wine to my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the next room all sounds of stirring had ceased. I looked up; greyhound
      clouds, long and lean, coursed in pursuit of stars across the moon. I
      tiptoed to the window. As I leant out, I heard a faint sighing. I caught
      the glint of copper-gold hair poured across the sill of the neighboring
      window. Fearing she might see me, I drew back. Why was it, I asked myself,
      that Fiesole was not my woman? What was the reason for this fantastic
      loyalty to Vi, who could never be mine? Was it instinct that held me back
      from Fiesole or mere cold-heartedness?
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next three days we wandered Venice, doing the usual round of
      churches and palaces. I was feverishly careful to live my life with
      Fiesole in public. I feared for her sake to be left alone with her. There
      was protection in spectators. She understood and accepted the situation,
      though we had not discussed it together. She played the part of a daring
      boy, carrying herself with merry independence. At times I almost forgot
      she was a girl. She disarmed my watchfulness, and seemed bent on showing
      me that it was unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the fourth day, we returned to déjeuner parched and
      footsore from exploring the stifling alleys which lie back of the Rialto.
      The air was heavy and sultry. The water seemed to boil in the canals.
      Every stone flung back the steady glare. Blue lagoons, polished as
      reflectors, mirrored the blue of the cloudless sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      From where we sat at table, we could see crowded steamers draw in at the
      pier and crawl like flies across the bay to Lido.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiesole made a queer little face at me. &ldquo;Stupid old sober-sides!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flung herself back in her chair, regarding me with a languid, arch
      expression. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of fudging in and out of old palaces and churches.
      I came here to enjoy myself. If I promise to be a good girl, will you take
      me to Lido to bathe? We&rsquo;ll have one dear little afternoon all to
      ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A warm breeze caught us on the steamer. What ripe lips Fiesole had, and
      what inscrutable eyes! Since that first night of our arrival, she had
      prevented me from treating her with any of the privileges of her sex. She
      had walked when and where she liked. She had insisted on paying her share
      of everything down to the last centesimi. Now she changed her mood and
      slipped her arm through mine. We had both grown tired of pretending she
      was a man. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be afraid to be nice to me,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were lovers all about us: girls from the glass-factories in white
      dresses, bareheaded, with tasseled black shawls; sailors from the Arsenal
      with keen bronzed faces and silky mustaches. Venice was taking a day off
      and giving us a lesson in happiness. The self-consciousness of the
      Anglo-Saxon, which makes the expression of pleasure bad taste and
      distressing, was absent. Each was occupied with him or herself, sublimely
      unconscious of spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I been nice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She patted my hand, entirely the woman now. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been trying to be
      correct. Why can&rsquo;t you be your own dear self?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taking the tram across the island, we came to the Stabilimento dei Bagni.
      We walked through the arcade and down on to the terrace. The sea rolled in
      flashing, green and silver, in a long slow swell. Leaning over the side,
      we watched the bathers. Men, with costumes unfastened at the shoulders,
      sifted golden sand through their fingers on to their naked chests. Women
      lay beside them, buried in the sand, laughing and chatting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I noticed a blond young giant standing at the water&rsquo;s edge. His face
      kindled. I followed the direction in which he was looking. A dark-eyed
      girl had come out of her cabin. She wore a single-piece, tight-fitting
      suit of stockingette, which displayed her figure in all its splendid
      curves. Her face was roguish and vivid as that of Carmen. On her head she
      wore a scarlet turban. Her costume was sky blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men who had been lying on their backs, turned over and regarded her
      with lazy admiration of her physical loveliness. Seemingly unaware of the
      interest she aroused, she came tripping daintily to the water&rsquo;s edge, her
      white limbs flashing. The man held out his hand. With little birdlike
      exclamations she ran to him; then drew back and shivered as the first wave
      rippled about her feet. He encouraged her with tender, quickly spoken
      words. Her timidity was all a pretty pretense and they both knew it; but
      it gave them a chance to be charming to one another. He seized her hand
      again; she hung back from him laughing. Then they waded out together,
      hand-in-hand, splashing up diamonds as they went. They seemed to see no
      one but each other; they eyed one another innocently, unabashed. When they
      came to the deeper water, she clasped her arms about his neck; he swam out
      toward the horizon with her riding on his back. He was like a young
      sea-god capturing a land-maiden.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stab of envy shot through me. I felt indignant with my inherited
      puritanism. It would not permit me simply to enjoy myself. I must be
      forever analyzing motives, and lifting the lid off the future to search
      for consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at Fiesole. Her eyes were starry. They seemed to mock me and
      plead with me saying, &ldquo;Oh, Dannie, why can&rsquo;t we be like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I glanced down at the beach. The bathers were rising up and shaking off
      the sand. I noticed that only the women who had no beauty hid themselves
      behind bathing-skirts. The Italian standard of modesty!&mdash;you only
      need be modest when you have something to be ashamed of. I accepted the
      standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiesole broke the silence, clapping her hands, crying &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t she
      perfect!&rdquo; Then she took hold of my face in childish excitement and turned
      my head. &ldquo;Oh, look there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An English girl had come out. Her bathing-suit was drab-colored and baggy.
      Sagging about her knees hung an ugly skirt. In her clothes she might have
      been pretty; but now she was awkward and embarrassed. Her manner called
      attention to the fact that she was more sparsely clad than usual. She wore
      tight round her forehead a wretched waterproof cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Miss England,&rdquo; laughed Fiesole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we bathe, you be Miss Italy,&rdquo; I laughed back.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I look back to that sunny July afternoon with the blue and silver
      Adriatic singing against the lips of the land, the warm wind blowing
      toward the shore from Egypt&rsquo;s way, the daring flashing of slim white
      bodies tossed high by glistening waves, and the undercurrent merriment of
      laughter and secret love-making, I know that I had ventured as far as is
      safe into the garden which knows no barriers. It is as I saw her then that
      I like to remember Fiesole. I can see her coming down the golden sands,
      with a tress of her gold-red hair, that had escaped, lying shining between
      her breasts. I recall her astonishing girlishness, which she had hidden
      from me so long. Like a wild thing of the woods, she came to me at last,
      timid in her daring, halting to glance back at the green covert, advancing
      again with glad shy gestures. Whatever had gone before was gallant
      make-belief. Without a word spoken, as her eyes met mine she told me all
      at the water&rsquo;s edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon I learnt the absurd delirium that may overtake a man who is
      owned in public by a pretty woman. She was the prettiest woman in Italy
      that day from her small pink feet to her golden crown. And she knew it.
      She treated me as though I was hers and, forgetting everything, I was glad
      of it. I can still thrill with the boyish pride I felt when I fastened her
      dress, with all the beach watching. Whatever she asked me to do was a
      delightful form of flattery. It pleased me to know that others were
      suffering the same pangs of envy that I had felt. They were saying to
      themselves, &ldquo;How charming she is! What a lucky fellow! That&rsquo;s what youth
      can do for you. I wonder whether they&rsquo;re married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tucking her arm under mine with a delicious sense of proprietorship, we
      set out with the crowd through the tropic growth of flowers to the pier
      from where the steamer started. A little way ahead I saw the blond giant
      with his gay little sweetheart. He was all care of her. She fluttered
      about him like a blue butterfly about a tall sunflower. She looked up into
      his face, making impertinent grimaces. He nodded his head and laughed
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it only the spirit of imitation that caused us to copy them? They gave
      us a glimpse into the tender lovers&rsquo; world, which we both were sick with
      longing to enter. If Fiesole was playing a part she played it well. Her
      cheeks flushed and her eyes were brilliant. She made me feel the same
      bewilderment of gladness I had felt all those years ago, as a boy at the
      Red House. How much it would have meant to me then if she had treated me
      as she did now!
    </p>
    <p>
      We crossed the bay towards the hour of sunset. Venice swooned in a golden
      haze. Clouds struck sparks from the burning disk, like hammers falling on
      a glowing anvil. The lagoon stared at the sky without a quiver. We
      traveled a pathway of molten fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must live this day out,&rdquo; I said as we landed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the
      Bauer-Grunwald to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We hurried upstairs and changed into evening-dress. I tapped at her door,
      asking, &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All except some hooks and eyes. Come in,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was seated before the looking-glass, with her arms curved upward,
      tucking a bow of black ribbon in her hair. It was her reflection that
      looked into my face and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do me proud, Fiesole,&rdquo; I said, remembering one of Vi&rsquo;s phrases.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked as simple as a sixteen year old girl. Her dress was of pale
      green satin, cut high in the waist in Empire fashion, hanging without
      fullness to just above her ankles. The sleeves left off at the elbows. Her
      wonderful russet hair was gathered into a loose knot and lay coiled along
      her neck. She was the Fiesole of my school-days. Had she intended to
      remind me?
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat down on the edge of the bed while she finished her dressing,
      following with my eyes the feminine nick-nacks which were strewn about.
      But always my eyes came back to her, with the mellow glory from the window
      transfiguring her face and neck. There was a nipping sweetness in being so
      near to a woman whom I could not hope to possess. I knew that without
      marrying her I could not keep her. Platonic friendships are only safe
      between men and women whose youth is withered. I was wise enough to know
      that. We were chance-met travelers in Lovers&rsquo; Land&mdash;truants who would
      soon be dragged back. I kept saying to myself, &ldquo;Intimacy such as we have
      can go but a short way further; any hour all this may end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I tried to imagine how this evening would seem to me years hence. The
      poignancy of life&rsquo;s changefulness made me wistful. One day we should both
      be old. We should be free from tempestuous desires. The generous fires of
      youth would have burnt out. We should know the worth then of the pleasures
      we now withheld from one another. We should meet, having grown commonsense
      or satiated, and would wonder wherein lay the mastering attraction we had
      felt&mdash;from what source we had stolen our romance. We should be weary
      then, walking where our feet now ran. Why could we not last out this
      moment forever?
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, shaking down her skirt and courting my admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may get to work on the hooks and eyes, old boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was jerky with excitement. My fingers were awkward with
      trembling. As I leant over her, she patted my cheek, flashing a caress
      with her eyes. &ldquo;Do you know, you&rsquo;re handsome, Dante?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to crush her in my arms, but my habitual restraint prevented. I
      should destroy the virginal quality in her&mdash;something which could
      never be put back. My mind conjured the scene. I saw her folded against
      me, her eyes brimming up to mine in tender amazement. But my arms went on
      with their business, as though some strong power held them down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s done. Come, bambino, it&rsquo;s getting late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She followed me down the stairs. My senses were reeling with the maddening
      fragrance of her presence. We walked through the Piazzetta and Piazza di
      San Marco, through the narrow streets and across the bridges till we
      arrived at the garden beside the canal. Arbors were illumined with
      faery-lamps. It seemed a scene staged for a theatre rather than a living
      actuality. Gondolas stole past the garden through the dusk. Mysterious
      people alighted. Guitars tinkled. In tall mediaeval houses rising
      opposite, lamps flashed and women looked down. As specters in a dream,
      people leant above the bridge, gazed into the water, and vanished. Venice
      walked with slippered feet and finger to lips that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence shivered; a clear peal of laughter rippled on the air. We
      turned. The girl with the young sea-god was entering the garden. They
      seated themselves at a table near us&mdash;so near that we could watch
      their expressions and overhear much that was said. It seemed they were
      fated to goad us on and make us ambitious of attaining their happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiesole stretched out her hands. I smiled and took them, holding them
      palms up. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re like petals of pink roses,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face was laughing. &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m pretty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always thought that, and you know it&mdash;ever since you wouldn&rsquo;t
      kiss me in Sneard&rsquo;s garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was you who wouldn&rsquo;t ask to be kissed,&rdquo; she pouted. &ldquo;What you could
      have, you didn&rsquo;t value. It&rsquo;s the same now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hands quivered; her lips became piteous. All the wild commotion of her
      heart seemed to travel through them to myself. My throat became suddenly
      parched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know how it is, Fiesole. It isn&rsquo;t that I haven&rsquo;t affection for you;
      but to do that kind of thing, if I don&rsquo;t intend to make you more to me,
      wouldn&rsquo;t be fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I want it? What if I were to tell you, Dante, that you&rsquo;re the only
      man I&rsquo;ve ever cared for? What if I were to tell you that you&rsquo;ve always
      been first in my heart, ever since we first met?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked away from her to the street of water. I had nothing with which to
      answer. She tried to drag her hands from me, but still I held them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dante,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;look at me.&rdquo; Her voice grew fainter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
      speaking of marriage. Two people can be kind to one another without that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have I been unkind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned from my question. &ldquo;You can never marry her,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You
      know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A long silence elapsed, which was broken by voices of the girl and her
      lover at the neighboring table. Fiesole spoke again. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not married.
      They never will be married. And yet they can share with one another one
      little corner of their lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me it&rsquo;s all or nothing,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t all, I should be
      forever thinking of the end. That&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m made&mdash;it&rsquo;s my training.
      If I did anything to you, Fiesole, that wounded you ever so little, I
      should hate myself. Wherever you were, I should be thinking of you&mdash;wanting
      to leave everything to come to you. I can&rsquo;t forget. My conscience would
      give me no rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew her hands free. &ldquo;And yet you&rsquo;re wounding me now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was always different from other women, doing the unexpected. Instead
      of sitting melancholy through dinner, she broke into a burst of high
      spirits. She told me about her father, who had marched with Garibaldi. She
      rallied me on the awkward little boy I had been when first we met&mdash;all
      arms, and legs, and shyness. She talked of love in a bantering fashion, as
      insanity of the will. One minute she was the cynical woman of the world&mdash;the
      next the innocent young school-girl. She puzzled and played with me. Then
      she fell back into the vein of tenderness, recalling the good times we had
      had, stampeding through the Cotswolds in springtime with the mad wind
      blowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearing midnight when we rose. Going down the little garden, we
      halted on the steps by the canal. A dozen shadowy figures leapt up with
      hoarse cries. We beckoned to a poppe; the gondola stole up and we entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go back yet,&rdquo; Fiesole pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      We crept through ancient waterways, all solitary and silent; past churches
      blanched in the moonlight, and empty piazzas; under bridges from which
      some solitary figure leant to observe us. Now a swiftly moving barca would
      overtake us; as it fled by we had a glimpse through the curtains of a man
      and a woman sitting close together. Now the door of a tavern would
      suddenly open, flinging across the water a bar of garish light; cloaked
      figures would emerge and the door would close as suddenly as it had
      opened. Overhead in balconies we sometimes detected the stir of life where
      we had thought there was emptiness, and would catch the rustle of a
      woman&rsquo;s dress or see the red flare of a cigarette. We had the haunted
      sensation one has in a wood in May-time: though he discerns but little
      with the eye, he is conscious that behind green leaves an anonymous,
      teeming world is mating and providing for its momentous cares.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiesole pressed against me; the darkness seemed to fling out hands,
      thrusting us together. She slipped off her hood and pushed back her cloak,
      displaying her arms and throat and hair. The seduction of her beauty
      enthralled and held me spellbound. The air pulsated with illicit
      influences. The dreaming city, vague and labyrinthine, was the outward
      symbol of my state of mind. I had lost my standards; my will-power was too
      inert to rouse itself for their recovery. I was entranced by a sensuous
      inner vision of loveliness which exhausted my faculties of resistance. I
      apprehended some fresh allurement of femininity through each portal of
      sense. Fiesole&rsquo;s touch made my flesh burn; her eyes stung me to pity; her
      voice caressed me. Her body relaxed till it rested the length of mine. Her
      head lay against my shoulder; her arms were warm about my neck. I tried to
      think&mdash;to think of honor and duty; but I could only think of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what you said about Simonetta,&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;how you thought
      I was like her and you spent hours before <i>The Kingdom of Venus</i>. You
      were wrong, all wrong, Dante, in your thoughts about her. The young man in
      the picture was Giuliano dei Medici and Simonetta was dear to him for many
      years. So the flowers weren&rsquo;t broken, Dannie. Instead of broken flowers,
      they made poetry for Botticelli to paint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How could I tell her that there was a difference between love and passion?&mdash;that
      my feeling for her could be only passion, because my love was with Vi? She
      loved me&mdash;that made all her actions pure. Morality would sound like
      the rasping voice of a tired schoolmaster, scolding a classroom of healthy
      boys. It was even unsafe for me to pity her; when I drew my coat about
      her, she kissed my hand. I clasped her closely, gazing straight ahead, not
      daring to look down. Every quiver of her languorous body communicated
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiesole, if I don&rsquo;t marry her, I will marry you some day. I promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want you now&mdash;now&mdash;now.&rdquo; Her whisper was sharp-edged with
      longing; it beat me down and ran out among the shadows like a darting
      blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      We floated under the Bridge of Sighs and drew up at the landing. She leant
      heavily on my arm. We walked along the quay in silence. Few people were
      about. I saw mistily; my eyes were burning as if they had gazed too long
      into a glowing furnace. She drooped against me like a crushed flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re breaking my heart, Fiesole. I&rsquo;d give you anything, but the thing
      that would hurt you. Let me have time to consider.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was saying to myself, &ldquo;Perhaps it would be right to marry her.&rdquo; But the
      memory of her whisper clamored insistently in my ears and prevented me
      from thinking, &ldquo;<i>I want you now&mdash;now&mdash;now.</i>&rdquo; With her voice
      she made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      We entered the hotel and stole past the office; the porter was sleeping
      with his head bowed across his arms. On the dimly lit stairs she dragged
      on my arm, so that I halted. Suddenly she freed herself and broke from me,
      running on ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing still, almost hiding from her, I listened for her door to open
      and shut. Nothing stirred. I crept along the naked passage and found her
      leaning against the wall outside our rooms. Her head was thrown back in
      weariness, not in defiance; her arms were spread out helplessly; her
      hands, with palms inward, wandered blindly over the wall&rsquo;s surface. She
      was panting like a hunted fawn. Her knees shook under her. Her attitude
      was horribly that of one who had been crucified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Made reckless by remorse, I bent over her and kissed her. Because I did
      not put my arms about her, she made no response.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something happened, wholly inexplicable, as though we had been joined by a
      third presence. Not a stair creaked. Everyone was in bed. The air was
      flooded with the slow, sweet smell of violets. I became aware of a
      palpitating sense of moral danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      I drew back from Fiesole. Her physical fascination faded from me; yet I
      had never felt more tender towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, dear,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She met my gaze with a frozen, focusless expression of despair. Her hands
      ceased their wandering.
    </p>
    <p>
      I entered my room and, closing the door, stood pressed against the panel,
      listening. After what seemed an interminable silence, her door opened and
      shut. I looked out into the passage; it was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent a sleepless night and rose with my mind made up; since she wanted
      it I would marry her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going downstairs, I found she had not breakfasted. As a rule she was an
      earlier riser than myself; usually I found her waiting for me. I went for
      a stroll on the Piazzetta to give her time. On my return she had not
      appeared. I was beginning to grow nervous; then it occurred to me that she
      was postponing the first awkwardness of meeting me by breakfasting in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking my place at our table in the window, I told the waiter to carry
      Fiesole&rsquo;s rolls and coffee up to her bedroom. He looked a trifle blank,
      and hurried away without explanation. He returned, followed by the
      proprietor, who informed me with much secret amusement that the signora
      had called for her bill at seven o&rsquo;clock that morning and had departed,
      taking her baggage. I inquired if she had left any message for me; the
      proprietor stifled a laugh and shook his head. I immediately looked up
      trains, to discover which one she had intended catching. There was one
      which had left Venice at eight for Milan. At the station I found that a
      lady resembling Fiesole had taken a ticket for the through-journey. By
      this time it was ten; the next train did not leave till two o&rsquo;clock. I
      sent a telegram to catch her at Brescia, to be delivered to her in the
      carriage. No reply had been returned by the time I left Venice. I reached
      Milan in the evening and pursued my inquiries till midnight, but could get
      no trace of her. Either I had been mistaken in her direction, or she had
      alighted at one of the intermediate stations.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII&mdash;THE TURNING POINT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>efore my
      experience at Venice the world had consisted for me of Vi, myself, and
      other people; now it was only myself and Vi. I spent my days in shadowy
      unreality; just as a child, waking from a bad dream, sees one face he can
      trust gazing over the brink of his horror, so out of the blurred confusion
      of my present I saw the face of Vi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiesole had not shown me love in its purity, but she certainly had taught
      me something of its courage and selfishness. She had disabused my mind
      forever of the thought that it was a polite, intensified form of liking. A
      blazing ship, she had met me in mid-ocean and had set my rigging aflame. I
      had turned from her, but not in time to get off scatheless. Her wild
      unrestraint had accustomed my imagination to phases of desire which had
      before seemed abnormal and foreign to my nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I missed her at Milan, I abandoned my pursuit of her. Now that the
      temptation was over, I realized how near we had come to wrecking each
      other&rsquo;s lives. Physical lassitude overtook me. Because I had withstood
      Fiesole, I thought myself safe in indulging my fancy with more intimate
      thoughts of Vi. I excused myself for so doing, by telling myself that it
      was her memory that had made me strong to escape. It was like saying that
      because water had rescued me from fire it could no longer drown me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I traveled northwards into the mountains to Raveno. Each morning I rowed
      across Maggiore to the island of Isola Madré. Lying beneath the camphor
      trees, watching the turquoise of the lake filling in the spaces between
      the yellowing bamboo canes, I gave rein to my longing. Shadowy foliage
      dripped from shadowy trees, curtaining the glaring light; down spy-hole
      vistas of overgrown pathways I watched the lazy world drift by. I numbed
      my cravings with the opiate of voluptuous beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been there a fortnight when a letter from home arrived. With its
      confident domestic chatter, it brought a message of trust. It took from me
      my sense of isolation. One of them would understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the thought had taken shape within me that I must go to Vi. If I
      saw her only once again, I believed that I would be satisfied. It would
      not be necessary to speak to her&mdash;that would be unsportsmanlike if
      she had managed to forget me. All I asked was to be allowed just once to
      look upon her face. She should not know that I was near her; I would look
      at her and go away. With that strange sophistry that we practise on
      ourselves, I tried to be persuaded that, were I to see her in her own
      surroundings with her husband and Dorrie, it would be a lesson to me of
      how little share I had in her life. Perhaps I had even idealized her
      memory; seeing her might cure me. So I reasoned, but I was conscious that
      my own judgment on the wisdom of such a step was not to be trusted.
      Ruthita was too young to tell. My father, though I admired him, was not
      the man to whom a son would willingly betray a weakness. I would speak to
      the Snow Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I drove from the station through London, old scenes and memories woke
      to life. The city had spread out towards Stoke Newington, so that it had
      lost much of its quaintness; but it retained enough of its old-world quiet
      to put me in touch with my childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      I alighted at the foot of Pope Lane. The wooden posts still stood there to
      shut out traffic. I walked quickly up the avenue of fragrant limes with
      the eager expectancy of one who had been years absent instead of days. In
      the distance I heard the rumble of London. The golden August evening lay
      in pools upon the pathway. Sensations of the happy past came back. Dead
      memories stirred, plucking at my heartstrings. I thought of how Ruthita
      and I had bowled hoops and played marbles on that same gray pavement,
      making the air ring with our childish voices. I thought of those rare
      occasions when the Spuffler had carried me away with him into a boy&rsquo;s
      world of mysterious small things, which he knew so well how to find. All
      the comings and goings of school-days, immense exaltations and magnified
      tragedies, rose before me&mdash;Ruthita waiting to catch first sight of
      me, and Ruthita running beside the dog-cart, with flushed cheeks and hair
      flying, to share the last of me as I drove away. What had happened since
      then seemed for the moment but an interlude in the momentous play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing between the steeply-rising red-brick walls, dotted with gates, I
      came to the door through which I had been so eager to escape when it had
      been locked against me. I reflected that I had not gained much from the
      new things which I had dragged into my life. The narrowness which I had
      once detested as imprisoned dullness I now coveted as peaceful security.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found the bell beneath the Virginia creeper. The door was opened by
      Hetty. Hetty had grown buxom and middle-aged. Her sweetheart had never
      come for her. The tradesmen no longer made love to her; they left their
      goods perfunctorily and went out in search of younger faces. Her hips had
      broadened. The curve between her bust and her waist had vanished. The
      dream of love was all that she had gained from life. I wondered whether
      she still told herself impossible stories of the deliverance wrought by
      marriage. If she did, no signs of her romantic tendencies revealed
      themselves in her face. Her expression had grown vacantly kind and stolid.
      To me she was respectful nowadays, and seemed even distressed by the
      immodesty of the memory that I had once been the little boy whom she had
      spanked, spoilt, bathed, and dried.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a quick cry at catching sight of me, for I had warned no one of
      my coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh! where are they?&rdquo; I asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told me that the master was at work in his study, and that Miss
      Ruthita and her ma were in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked round the house slowly, lasting out the pleasure of their
      surprise. Nothing seemed to have changed except we people. Sunflowers kept
      guard in just the same places, like ranks of lean soldiers wearing golden
      helmets. Along the borders scarlet geraniums flared among the blue of
      lobelia and the white of featherfew, just as they had when I was a boy.
      Pigeons, descendants of those whose freedom I had envied, perched on the
      housetops opposite, or wheeled against the encrimsoned sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stole across the lawn to where two stooping figures sat with their backs
      towards me. Halfway across I halted, gazing over my shoulder. Through the
      study-window, with ivy aslant the pane, I saw my father. His hair was
      white.. In the stoop of his shoulders was the sign of creeping age. He did
      not look up to notice me; he had never had time. As the years went by I
      grew proudly sorry for him. I saw him now, as I had seen him so many times
      when I paused to glance up from my play. He was cramped above his desk,
      writing, writing. His face was turned away. His head was supported on his
      hand as though weary. <i>He</i> was-the prisoner now; it was I who held
      the key of escape. How oddly life had changed!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruthita saw me. Her sewing fell from her lap. In a. trice she was racing
      towards me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! You!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her thin arms went round me. Suddenly I felt miles distant from her
      because I was unworthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you come back?&rdquo; she asked me. There was a note of anxiety in her
      voice. She searched my bronzed face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see you, chickabiddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. That&rsquo;s not true,&rdquo; she whispered; but she pressed her cheek
      against my shoulder as though she were willing to distrust her own denial.
      &ldquo;You can get on quite well without me, Dannie; you would never have come
      back to see me only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Snow Lady touched me on the elbow. Her eyes were excited and full of
      questioning. She gazed quickly from me to Ruthita. With a
      self-consciousness which was foreign to both of us, we dropped our eyes
      under her gaze and separated. Ruthita excused herself, saying that she
      would go and tell my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Snow Lady offered me her cheek; it was soft and velvety. Slipping her
      arm through mine, she led me away to the apple-tree under which they had
      been sitting. She was still the frail little Madam Favart, half-frivolous,
      half-saintly; my father&rsquo;s intense reticence had subdued, but not quite
      silenced her gaiety. Her silver hair was as abundant as ever and her
      figure as girlish; but her face had tired lines, especially about the
      eyes. I sat myself on the grass at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is he?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much the same. He doesn&rsquo;t change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he still at the same old grind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;But, Dante,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you look thinner and older.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the heat and the rapid traveling. A day or two&rsquo;s rest&rsquo;ll put me
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dropped her sewing into her lap and, pressing her cool hand against my
      forehead, drew me back against her. It was a mothering love-trick of hers
      that had lasted over from my childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What brought you home so suddenly, laddie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hand slipped to my shoulder. I bent aside and kissed it. &ldquo;To see you
      and Ruthie. I had something to tell you.&rdquo; She narrowed her eyes shrewdly.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been worried for nearly a year now. I&rsquo;ve noticed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I shown it so plainly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plainly enough for me to notice. Is it something to do with a woman? But
      of course it is&mdash;at your age only a woman could make you wear a
      solemn face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s a woman. And I want you to help me, Snow Lady, just as you used
      to long ago when I couldn&rsquo;t make things go right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The slow tears clouded her eyes; yet my news seemed to make her happy.
      &ldquo;When I was as old as you, Ruthie had been long enough with me to grow
      long curls.&rdquo; She smiled inscrutably.
    </p>
    <p>
      From where we sat we could watch the house. While we had been talking, I
      had seen through the study-window how Ruthita stole to my father&rsquo;s chair.
      He looked up irritably at being disturbed. Her attitude was all meekness
      and apology as she explained her intrusion. He seemed to sigh at having to
      leave his work. She withdrew while he completed his sentence. He laid his
      pen carefully aside, glanced out into the garden shortsightedly, rose, and
      melted into the shadows at the back of his cave. The door at the top of
      the steps opened. He descended slowly and gravely, as though his brain was
      still tangled in the web of thought it had been weaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sat together beneath the apple-tree while the light faded. Little ovals
      of gold, falling flaky through leaves on the turf, paled imperceptibly
      into the twilight grayness. My father&rsquo;s voice was worn and unsteady. It
      came over me that he had aged; up till now I had not noticed it. Beyond
      the wall in a neighboring garden children were playing; a woman called
      them to bed; a lawn-mower ran to and fro across the silence. He questioned
      me eagerly as to where I had been in Italy, punctuating my answers and
      descriptions with such remarks as, &ldquo;I always wanted to go there&mdash;never
      had time&mdash;always felt that such a background would have made all the
      difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was noticeable that Ruthita and the Snow Lady suppressed themselves in
      his presence; if they ventured anything, it was only to keep him
      interested or to lead his thoughts in happier directions. Presently he
      told them that they would be tired if they sat up later. Taking the hint
      as a command, they bade us good-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darkness had gathered when they left us; to the southward London waved a
      torch against the clouds. We watched the lights spring up in the bedrooms,
      and saw Ruthita and then the Snow Lady step to their windows and draw down
      their blinds. Presently the lights went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Halloway&rsquo;s been here again.&rdquo; When I waited for further explanation
      my father added, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t like the fellow at first; he improves on
      acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I spoke. &ldquo;Depends how far you carry his acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My father fidgeted in his chair. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got flaws in his character, but
      he&rsquo;s honest in keeping back nothing. Most people in our position wouldn&rsquo;t
      hesitate two minutes over such a match.&rdquo; Then, after a long pause, &ldquo;And
      what&rsquo;s to become of Ruthita when I die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took him up sharply. I was young enough to fear the mention of death.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll live for many years yet. After that, I&rsquo;ll take care of her if she
      doesn&rsquo;t marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My father sat upright. I wondered how I had hurt him. He spoke stiffly.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll inherit Sir Charles&rsquo;s money. When I married a first and a second
      time, I didn&rsquo;t consult his convenience, and the responsibilities I
      undertook are mine. Ruthita&rsquo;s only your sister by accident; already you&rsquo;ve
      been too much together. We must consider this offer apart from sentiment.
      He&rsquo;s sowed his wild oats&mdash;well, he&rsquo;s sorry. And he&rsquo;ll be the Earl of
      Lovegrove by and by. To stand in her way would be selfishness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His argument took me by surprise. &ldquo;Is Ruthita anxious for it? What does
      she say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knows nothing of the world. She takes her coloring from you. She&rsquo;s
      afraid to speak out her mind. She thinks you would never forgive her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice was high-strung and challenging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; I said quietly. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t love him&mdash;she&rsquo;d be
      selling herself for safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the interval that followed I could feel the grimness of his expression
      which the darkness hid from my eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re young; you don&rsquo;t understand.
      For years I&rsquo;ve had to struggle to make ends meet. I&rsquo;m about done&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      tired. If Ruthita were settled, I could lie down with an easy mind.
      There&rsquo;s enough saved to see me and her mother to our journey&rsquo;s end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose to his feet suddenly. &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m acting shabbily. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked away, a gaunt shadow moving through the silver night. The awe I
      had of him kept me from following. I sat there and tried to puzzle out how
      this thing might be avoided. I could help financially; but my help would
      be refused because it was Sir Charles&rsquo;s money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning I woke at six and dressed. Dew was on the turf; it sparkled
      in the gossamer veils of spider-webs caught among the bushes. Blackbirds
      and thrushes in trees were calling. A cock crew, and a cock in the
      distance echoed. The childish thought came back to me&mdash;how much
      grown-ups miss of pleasure in their anxiety for the morrow. There is so
      much to be enjoyed for nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      A window-sash was raised sharply. Looking up I saw Ruthita in her white
      night-gown, with her hair tumbled like a cloud about her breast. I watched
      her, thinking her lovely&mdash;so timid and small and delicate. I called
      to her softly; she started and drew back. I waited. Soon she came down to
      me in the garden. I must have eyed her curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hand pleadingly, afraid that I would judge her. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
      making me,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t want to, Dannie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I led her away behind the tool-shed at the bottom of the garden; it was
      the place where I had discovered Hetty in her one flirtation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not wanted,&rdquo; moaned Ruthita; &ldquo;I cost money. So they&rsquo;re giving me to a
      man I don&rsquo;t love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I told her, slipping my arm about her. &ldquo;You shall come to
      me&mdash;I don&rsquo;t suppose I shall ever marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nestled her head against my shoulder, saying, &ldquo;You were always good to
      me; I don&rsquo;t know why. I&rsquo;m not much use to anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; I retorted. &ldquo;None of us could get along without you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I told her that if the pressure became unbearable she must come to
      me. She promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Snow Lady found us sitting there together; we made room for her beside
      us. Shortly after her coming Ruthita made an excuse to vanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned to the Snow Lady abruptly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not going to marry Halloway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her brows, laughing with her eyes. &ldquo;Why not? Why so positive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s an arranged marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine with her father was arranged; it was very happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somehow I knew she was not serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want it?&rdquo; I challenged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want it; but Ruthita&rsquo;s growing older. No one else has asked
      for her. It would be a shame if she became an old maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t, if you say so,&rdquo; said the Snow Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      During breakfast my father was silent. He seemed conscious of a conspiracy
      against him. When the meal was ended, he retired to his study, where he
      shut himself up, working morosely. I sought opportunities to tell the Snow
      Lady what I had come to say, but I could never find an opening to
      introduce the name of Vi. Whenever we were alone together she insisted on
      discussing Ruthita&rsquo;s future, stating and re-stating the reasons for and
      against the proposed match. The atmosphere was never sympathetic for the
      broaching of my own perplexities. Gradually I came to see that I must make
      my decision unaided; then I knew that I should decide in only one way. I
      engaged a passage to Boston provisionally, telling myself that it could be
      canceled. That I think was the turning-point, though I still pretended to
      hesitate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day before the boat sailed, my father announced at table, avoiding my
      eyes, that Lord Halloway had written that he would call next day. I went
      to my bedroom and commenced to pack. Ruthita followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were blinded with tears; she sank against the wall in a fit of
      sobbing. &ldquo;Oh, I wish you could take me&mdash;I wish you could take me!&rdquo;
       she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      I comforted her, telling her to be brave, reminding her of her promise to
      come to me if they used pressure. She dabbed her eyes. &ldquo;You and I&rsquo;ve
      always stood together, little sister; you mustn&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; I told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I carried my bags downstairs into the hall. The Snow Lady met me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? You&rsquo;re going?&rdquo; Her voice reflected dismay and bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not for long! You&rsquo;ll be back shortly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I entered my father&rsquo;s study. He looked up from his writing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held my hand in silence a moment; his throat was working; he would not
      look me in the eyes. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you stay?&rdquo; he asked hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t judge us harshly. Come back again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruthita accompanied me to the end of the lane. She did not come further;
      she was grown up now and ashamed to be seen crying. At the last minute I
      wanted to tell her. I realized that she would understand&mdash;she was a
      woman. The knowledge came too late. She said she would write me at Oxford,
      and I did not correct her. I looked back as I went down the road and
      waved. I turned a corner; she was lost to sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day I sailed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV&mdash;I GO TO SHEBA
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> sleepy, contented
      little town, overshadowed by giant elms, sprawled out along the banks of a
      winding river, surrounded for miles by undulating woodlands&mdash;that is
      how I remember Sheba. The houses were for the most part of timber, and
      nearly all of them were painted white. They sat each in its unfenced
      garden, comfortably separate from neighbors, with a green lawn flowing
      from the roadway all about it, and a nosegay of salvias, hollyhocks, and
      lavender, making cheerfulness beside the piazza. I suppose unkind things
      happened there, but they have left no mark on my memory. When I think of
      Sheba there comes to me the sound of bees humming, woodpeckers tapping,
      frogs croaking, and the sight of blue indolent smoke curling above quiet
      gables, butterflies sailing over flowers, a nodding team of oxen on a
      sunlit road hauling fagots into town and, after sunset hour, the indigo
      silence of dusk beneath orchards where apples are dropping and fireflies
      blink with the eyes of goblins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sheba was one of those old New England towns from which the hurry of life
      has departed; it cared more for its traditions than for its future, and
      sat watching the present like a gray spectacled grandmother, pleased to be
      behind the times, with its worn hands folded.
    </p>
    <p>
      I arrived there with only a small sum of money and the price of my return
      passage. I had limited my funds purposely, so that I might not be tempted
      to prolong my visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after my arrival my calculations were upset; I discovered that the
      Carpenter house was shut, and that Mr. and Mrs. Carpenter had not yet
      returned from the coast. This made me careful. I was unwilling to draw on
      my bank in London lest my whereabouts should be discovered, which would
      necessitate awkward explanations to my family and the association of Vi&rsquo;s
      name with doubtful circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my search for cheap lodgings I had a strange stroke of luck. Randall
      Carpenter&rsquo;s house stood in an old-world street, which at this time of the
      year was a tunnel through foliage. I waited until the gardeners had
      departed. Evening came; pushing open the gate, I entered the grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      I passed down a rough path under apple-trees, where fruit kept falling. In
      stables to the left, horses chafed in their stalls and snorted. To the
      right in the vegetable garden, birds of brilliant plumage flashed and
      darted, and fat gray squirrels sat up quivering to watch me. Overhead,
      near and far, the air vibrated with incessant twittering. The golden haze
      of sunset was over everything; the whole world seemed enkindled. The path
      descended to low, flat meadows where haymaking was in progress. Farm
      implements stood carelessly about, ready for the morrow. In one field the
      hay was cocked, in another gathered, in a third the cutting had commenced.
      I told myself I was with her, and shivered at the aching loneliness of
      reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Circling the meadows was a narrow stream, which at a little distance
      joined the main river; on the farther side stood scattered cottages, with
      gardens straggling down a hill to its banks. In one of these a gray-haired
      woman was working. She wore a sunbonnet and print-dress of lavender. In my
      idleness I threw myself down in the grass and observed her. She grew
      conscious that she was being watched, and cast sly glances across her
      shoulder. At first I thought she was suspicious of my trespassing; she
      came lower down the hill and nodded in shy friendly fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening,&rdquo; I called to her over the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew herself erect and eyed me. &ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re a stranger?&rdquo; she
      questioned, having found something foreign in my English accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told her that I was, and then, for the sake of conversation, asked her
      if she knew of any rooms to rent. &ldquo;Guess I do,&rdquo; she called back, &ldquo;me and
      my sisters have one room to spare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was how I came to take lodgings with the three Misses Januaries. I
      paid them ten dollars weekly and had everything found. My room lay at the
      back; from my window I could see much of what went on in Randall
      Carpenter&rsquo;s grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the three Misses Januaries I learnt many things. They were decayed
      ladies and eked out a livelihood by bringing home piece-work to do for the
      jewelry factories. Every other day Miss Priscilla, the eldest, went to
      deliver the finished task and to take further orders. Miss Priscilla was
      proud, angular, and bent. Miss Julia was round and jolly, but crippled
      with rheumatism. Miss Lucy, the youngest, had a weak spine and was never
      dressed; day after day she lay between white sheets dreamily smiling,
      small as a child, making hardly any mound in the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first they hid from me the fact that they worked. Then they pretended
      that they did it to occupy their leisure. Sewing was so useless, Miss
      Priscilla said. At last they admitted the truth to the extent of letting
      me sit with them in Miss Lucy&rsquo;s bedroom, even allowing me to help them
      with the fastening of the interminable links that went to the making of
      one chain-bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during these meetings that they gossiped of their neighbors and
      themselves. By delicate manouvering I would lead the conversation round to
      Vi. I found that for them Sheba was the one and only town, and Randall
      Carpenter was its richest citizen. He stood behind all its thriving
      institutions. He was president of the Sheba National Bank. He had
      controlling interest in the jewelry factory. He owned the cotton-works. He
      had been Senator at Washington. Vi was the social leader and the mirror of
      local fashion. They spoke of her as though she embodied for them all that
      is meant by romance. They told me the story, which I had already heard, of
      how Randall Carpenter had saved her father from ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      While such matters were being discussed and fresh details added, Miss Lucy
      would smile up at the ceiling, with her thin arms stretched straight out
      and her fingers plucking at the coverlet. I discovered later that long
      years before, Randall Carpenter had kept company with her; then her spine
      trouble had commenced and their money had gone from them, and it had been
      ended. As a middle-aged bachelor he had married Vi, and now Miss Lucy
      re-lived her own girlhood in listening to stories of Vi&rsquo;s reported
      happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three weeks after my arrival in Sheba Vi returned. The evening before I
      had seen from my window that lights had sprung up in the house; early next
      morning I saw Dorrie in the garden, a white, diminutive, butterfly figure
      fluttering beneath the boughs. After breakfast I saw Vi come out, walking
      with a portly man. An eighth of a mile separated us&mdash;by listening
      intently I could hear her voice when she called, &ldquo;Dorrie, Dorrie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Twice I came near to her, though she did not know it. One Sunday morning I
      waited till service had commenced, and followed her to church. I slipped
      into a seat at the back. There were few people present. From where I sat I
      could get a clear view of her and her husband across empty pews. Mr.
      Carpenter was a squarely-built, kindly-looking man&mdash;unimaginative and
      mildly corpulent. His face was clean-shaven and ruddy. He had an air of
      benevolent prosperity; his hair was grizzled, the top of his head was bald
      and polished. When he offered me the plate in taking the collection, I
      noticed that his fingers were podgy. I remembered Vi&rsquo;s continually
      reiterated assertion that he was so kind to her. I knew what she had meant&mdash;kind,
      but lacking subtlety in expressing the affections. I judged that he was
      the sort of person to whom life had scattered largesse&mdash;he had never
      been tested, and consequently accepted all good fortune as something
      merited. His wide shrewd eyes had a steely gleam of justice; the puckered
      eye-lids promised humor. He was lovable rather than likable&mdash;a big
      boy, a mixture of naïve self-complacency and masterfulness. Before the
      benediction was pronounced, I left.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the first time I had seen him at close quarters. I had come
      prepared to find faults in the man; I was surprised at my lack of anger.
      His comfortable amiability disarmed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second time I came near to her was at nightfall. It was November. A
      touch of frost had nipped the leaves to blood-red; the Indian Summer had
      commenced. The air was pungent with the walnut fragrance of decaying
      foliage; violet mist trailed in shreds from thickets, like a woman&rsquo;s scarf
      torn from her throat in the passage. I had wandered out into the country.
      An aimless restlessness was on me&mdash;a sense of defiant
      self-dissatisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occupied with my thoughts, I was strolling moodily along with hands in
      pockets, when I chanced to look up. She was coming down the road towards
      me. She was alone; her trim, clean-cut figure made a silhouette against
      the twilight. She was whistling like a boy as she approached; her skirt
      was short to the ankles; she carried a light cane in her hand. I wanted to
      stand still till she had come up with me and then to catch her in my arms
      before she was aware. For a moment I halted irresolute; then I turned into
      the woods to the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not understand how she could be so near to me and not know it. It
      seemed to me that I would raise clenched hands against the coffin-lid,
      were she to approach me, though I was buried deep underground.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the year drew towards a close my uncertainty of mind became a torture.
      I knew that I ought to return to England; I was breaking the promise I had
      made to myself. My friends must be getting anxious. By this time Sir
      Charles must have heard of my disappearance. I was imperiling my future by
      stopping. Worse still, the longer I lived near Vi, the more difficult was
      I making it for myself to take up the threads of my old life without her.
      I continually set dates for my departure, and I continually postponed
      them. At last I booked my passage some way ahead for the first week in
      January. In order to prevent myself from altering my decision, I told Miss
      Priscilla that I was going.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fought a series of never finished battles with myself. As the time of my
      respite shortened, I grew frenzied. Was I to go away forever without
      speaking to her? Was I to give her no sign of my presence? Was I to let
      her think that I had forgotten her and had ceased to care? I kept myself
      awake of nights on purpose to make my respite go further; from where I lay
      on the pillow with my face turned to the snow-covered meadows, I could see
      the blur which was her house. Sometimes in the darkness, when one loses
      all standards, I determined to risk everything and go to her. With morning
      I mastered myself and saw clearly&mdash;to go to her would be basest
      selfishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of my long tramps I had come upon a pond in a secluded stretch of
      woodland on the outskirts of Sheba. On the last evening before my
      departure I remembered it. I was in almost hourly fear of myself&mdash;afraid
      that I would seek her out. I planned diversions of thought and action for
      my physical self, so that my will might keep it in subjection. This
      evening, when I was at a loss what to do, the inclination occurred to go
      there skating.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I walked along the road, sleighs slid by with bells jingling. The merry
      golden windows of white houses in white fields brought a sense of
      peacefulness. The night was blue-black; the sky was starry; the air had
      that deceptive dryness which hides its coldness. Beneath the woods trees
      cast intricate sprawling traceries of shadows. Every now and then the
      frozen silence was shattered by the snapping of some overladen bough; then
      the whole wood shook and shivered as though it were spun from glassy
      threads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Picking my way through bushes, I came to the edge of the pond and sat down
      to adjust my skates. It was perhaps four hundred yards in extent and
      curved in the middle, so that one could not see from end to end. To the
      right grew a plantation of firs almost large enough for cutting; on the
      other three sides lay tangled swamp and brushwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had risen to my feet and was on the point of striking out, when I heard
      a sound which was unmistakable, <i>rrh! rrh! rrh!</i>&mdash;the sharp ring
      of skates cutting against ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a point above me at the edge of the fir-grove a figure darted out and
      vanished round the bend. The moon was just rising; behind bars of tall
      trunks I could see its pale disk shining&mdash;the pond had not yet caught
      its light.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt foolishly angry and disappointed that I was not to have my last
      evening to myself. I was jealous that some stranger, to whom it would lack
      the same intensity, should share this memory. Unreasonable chagrin held me
      hesitant; I was minded to steal away unnoticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intruder had reached the far end of the pond&mdash;there was silence.
      Then the <i>rrh! rrh! rrh!</i> commenced again, coming back. I set out to
      meet it; it was eerie for two people to be within earshot, but out of
      sight in that still solitude. We swung round the corner together; the moon
      peered above the tree-tops. For an instant we were face to face, staring
      into one another&rsquo;s eyes; then our impetus carried us apart into the dusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      I listened, and heard nothing but the brittle shuddering of icicles as
      boughs strained up to free themselves. Stealing back round the bend, I
      came upon her standing fixed and silent; as I approached her, she spread
      her hands before her eyes in a gesture of terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vi, Vi,&rdquo; I whispered, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Dante.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She muttered to herself in choking, babbling fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had put my arms about her, she ceased to speak, but her body was
      shaken with sobbing. She made no sound, but a deep convulsive trembling
      ran through her. I talked to her soothingly, trying to convince her I was
      real. Slowly she relaxed against me sighing, and trusted herself to look
      up at me, letting her fingers wander over my face and hands. I had brought
      her the bitterness of remembrance. Stooping, I kissed her mouth. &ldquo;Just
      once,&rdquo; I pleaded, &ldquo;after all these months of loneliness. I&rsquo;m going
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must,&rdquo; she said, freeing herself from my embrace and clasping her
      arms about my neck; &ldquo;oh, it&rsquo;s wrong, but I&rsquo;ve wanted you so badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I led her to the edge of the pond and removed her skates. The moon had now
      sailed above the spear-topped firs and the ice was a silver mirror.
      Walking through the muffled woods I told her of my coming to Sheba, of the
      window from which I had watched her, and of all that had happened. From
      her I learnt that she also had been going through the same struggle
      between duty and desire ever since we parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes I felt that it was no use,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t fight any
      longer&mdash;I must write or come to you. Then something would happen; I
      would read or hear of a woman who had done it, and in the revulsion I felt
      I realized how other people would feel about myself. And I saw how it
      would spoil Randall&rsquo;s life, and especially what it would mean to Dorrie.
      You can&rsquo;t tell your personal excuses to the world; it just judges you
      wholesale by what you do, and I couldn&rsquo;t bear that. It&rsquo;s so easy to slip
      into temptation, Dante, especially our kind of temptation; because we love
      one another, anything we might do seems good. You can only see what sin
      really is when you picture it in the lives of others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were walking apart now; she had withdrawn her arm from mine. &ldquo;I shall
      always love you,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never marry any other woman,&rdquo; I told her; &ldquo;I shall wait for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boy,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t even right for you to think of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, because there were things we dared not mention, we fell to talking
      about Dorrie, how she was growing, how she was losing her lisp, and all
      the tender little coaxing ways she had of making people happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      We came out of the woods on the road which led back to Sheba. The lights
      twinkling ahead and the occasional travelers passing, robbed us of the
      danger of being alone together. I think she had been waiting for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dante,&rdquo; she said, smiling at me bravely, &ldquo;there is only one thing for you
      to do&mdash;you must marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;some woman whom I don&rsquo;t love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but many men learn to love a second woman. I&rsquo;ve
      often thought you should be happy with Ruthita; you love her already.
      After you had had children, you&rsquo;d soon forget me. You&rsquo;d be able to smile
      about it. Then it would be easier for me to forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My answer was a tortured whisper. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible; I&rsquo;m not made like
      that. For my own peace of mind I almost wish I were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We came to the gate of her house. Across the snow, beneath the gloom of
      elms lighted windows smote the darkness with bars of gold. Within one of
      the rooms a man was stirring; he came to the panes and looked out,
      watching for her return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s always like that; he can&rsquo;t bear to be without me. I had one of my
      moods this evening, when I want to be alone&mdash;he knew it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you wanted to think of me; that&rsquo;s what you meant&mdash;why didn&rsquo;t
      you say it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One daren&rsquo;t say these things, when they&rsquo;re saying good-by, perhaps for
      ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had her hand on the gate, preparing to enter; we neither of us knew
      what to say at parting. The things that were in my heart I must not utter,
      and all other things seemed trivial. I looked from her to the burly figure
      framed in the glowing window. I pitied him with the proud pity of youth
      for age, a pity which is half cruel. After all, she loved me and we had
      our years before us. We could afford disappointment, we whose lives were
      mostly in the future; his life was two-thirds spent, and his years were
      running out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking up the path in his direction, I asked, &ldquo;Shall you tell him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has known for a year; it was only fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he was angry? He blamed you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was sorry. I wish he had blamed me. He blames himself, which is the
      hardest thing I have to bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vi,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a good man&mdash;better than I am. You must learn to
      love him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hand quickly; her voice was muffled. &ldquo;Good-night, my
      dearest, and good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gate clanged. As she ran up the path, I saw that her husband had moved
      from the window. He opened the door to her; in the lighted room I saw him
      put his arms about her. By the way she looked up at him and he bent over
      her, I knew she was confessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I shambled down the road, feeling very old and tired. I was so tired
      that I hardly knew how to finish my packing; I was cold, bitterly cold. I
      dragged myself to bed; in order to catch the boat in Boston, I had to make
      an early start next morning. My teeth were chattering and my flesh was
      burning. Several times in the night I caught myself speaking aloud, saying
      stupid, tangled things about Vi. Then I thought that what I had said had
      been overheard. I shouted angrily to them to go away, declaring, that I
      had not meant what I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      When my eyes closed, the stars were going out. &ldquo;It will soon be morning,&rdquo;
       I told myself; &ldquo;I must get up and dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I tried to get up, but my head would stick to the pillow and my body
      refused to work. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; I thought; &ldquo;never mind, I&rsquo;ll try later.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV&mdash;THE FLAME OF A SWORD
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>ne morning, it
      seemed the one on which I had planned to sail, I awoke in a strange room.
      I knew it was strange because the sun was pouring in across the bed, and
      the sun never looked through my window at the Misses Januaries&rsquo; till late
      in the afternoon. Something wet was on my forehead&mdash;a kind of bandage
      that came down low across my eyes almost preventing me from seeing
      anything. This set me wondering in a slow, thick-witted manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not much care how I came to be there&mdash;I felt effortless and
      contented; yet, in a lazy way, my mind became interested. I lay still,
      piecing together little scraps of happenings as I remembered them. The
      last thing I could recall that was rational was my attempting to get out
      of bed. Then came vague haunting shapes, too sweet and too horrible for
      reality&mdash;things which refused to be embodied and remained mere
      atmospheres in the brain, terrors and delights of sleep which slowly faded
      as the mind cleared itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pulled my hand from under the sheets and was surprised at the effort it
      took to raise it to my forehead. I heard the rustle of a starched skirt:
      it was the kind of sound that Hetty used to make in my childhood, when she
      came to dress me in the mornings and I pretended that I still slept. I
      used to think in those days that it was a stern clean sound which
      threatened me with soap and chilly water. Someone was bending over me; a
      cool voice said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move, Mr. Cardover. I&rsquo;ll do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bandage was pushed back and in the sudden rush of light I saw a young
      woman in a blue print-dress, standing beside my pillow. I tried to speak
      to her, but my mouth was parched and my voice did not make the proper
      sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to speak,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been sick, you know. Soon you&rsquo;ll
      feel better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stopped trying to talk and obeyed her, just as I used to obey Hetty. At
      the back of my mind I smiled to myself that I, a grown man, should obey
      her; she looked such a girl. After she had put water to my lips and passed
      a damp cloth over my face and hands, she nodded pleasantly and went back
      to her seat by the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      No&mdash;until now I had never seen this room. The walls were covered in
      cherry-colored satin, which was patterned in vertical stripes, with
      bunches of flowers woven in between the lines. All the wood-work was
      painted a gleaming white. Chippendale chairs and old-fashioned delicate
      bits of furniture stood about in odd corners. Between the posts of the big
      Colonial bed I could see a broad bay-window, with a seat going round it.
      Across the panes leafless boughs cast a net-work of shadows, and through
      them fell a bar of solid sunlight in which dust-motes were dancing by the
      thousand. Half-way down each side of the bed screens were standing, so
      that I could only see straight before me and a part of the room to the
      left and right beyond where they ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through weakness I was powerless to speak or stir, yet my swimming senses
      were anxiously alert. I saw objects without their perspective, as though I
      were gazing up through water. In the same way with sounds, I heard them
      thunderously and waited in suspense for their repetition. Though I lay so
      still, nothing missed my attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the quietness of the house I gathered that the hour was yet early. Far
      away cocks crew their rural challenge. On a road near by footsteps passed
      in a hurry. The whistle of a factory sounded; then I knew they had been
      footsteps of people going to work. Beneath the window a garden-roller
      clanged across gravel, and became muffled as it reached the turf. A door
      banged remotely; a few seconds later someone tapped on the door of my
      bedroom. The nurse laid aside her knitting and rustled over to the
      threshold. A question was asked in a low whisper and the nurse&rsquo;s voice
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman entered into the bar of sunlight and stood regarding me from the
      foot of the bed. With the immense indifference of weakness I gazed back.
      Her long, fine-spun hair hung loose about her shoulders like a mantle. She
      wore a blue dressing-gown, which she held together with one hand across
      her breast. Her eyes were still sleepy; she had come directly she had
      wakened to inquire after me. She smiled at me, nodding her head. She
      seemed very distant; I wanted to return her smile, but I had not the
      energy. I closed my eyes; when I looked again she had vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next few days I do not know how many people came and looked at me,
      whispered a few words and went. There was the old gray-haired doctor, with
      his military-bearing and his trick of pursing his lips and knitting his
      brows as he took my temperature. I had one visitor who was regular&mdash;Randall
      Carpenter. He looked years older. Tiptoeing into the room, he would seat
      himself in the bay-window; from there he would gaze at me moodily without
      a word, with his knees spread apart, and his podgy hands clasped together.
      Sometimes I would doze while he watched me and would awake to find him
      still there, his position unaltered. One thing I noticed; Vi and he were
      never in my room together.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these first days, which slipped by uncounted, I realized that I had
      been very near to death. It seemed to me that my spirit still hovered on
      the borderland and looked back across the boundary half-regretful. I had
      the feeling that life was a thing apart from me&mdash;something which I
      was unanxious to share. All these people came and went, but I could not
      respond to them. I desired only to be undisturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several times I had heard the shrill piping voice of Dorrie and the long
      low <i>hush</i> of someone warning her to speak less loudly. She would
      come to the door many times in the day, inquiring impatiently whether I
      were better. Sometimes she would leave flowers, which the nurse would put
      in water and set down by the side of my bed. I would watch them dreamily,
      saying to myself, &ldquo;Dorrie&rsquo;s flowers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon I heard her voice at the door, asking &ldquo;Nurth, how ith
      Dante?&rdquo; The nurse had left the room for a moment, so no one answered her
      question. I heard the door pushed wider, and stealthy feet slipping across
      the carpet. Round the edge of the screen came the excited face and little
      shining head. I held out my hand to her and tried to speak. Then I tried
      again and whispered, &ldquo;Dor-rie! Dorrie darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took my hand in both her small ones, trying to mask the fear which my
      changed appearance caused her. &ldquo;Dear Dante,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tho
      thorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me, Dorrie,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Dante, you&rsquo;ll get better, won&rsquo;t you? For my thake, Dante! Then we&rsquo;ll
      play together, like we uthed to.&rdquo; Tears trickled down her flushed cheeks
      as she questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      As her soft lips brushed me and her silky curls fell about my forehead, I
      felt for the first time that my grip on life was coming back. Lying there
      thinking things over confusedly, it had seemed hardly worth while trying
      to get better. It seemed worth while, now that I was reminded that there
      was such beautiful innocence as Dorrie&rsquo;s in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the nurse came back a few moments later, she shook her head at Dorrie
      reproachfully and tried to take her away from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he wanths me,&rdquo; cried Dorrie in self-defense, and I kept fast hold of
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that I began to gather strength. I noticed that as I threw off my
      lethargy, Vi&rsquo;s visits grew less frequent. When she came her manner was
      restrained; she entered hurriedly and made it appear that her only reason
      for coming was to confer with the nurse. At first I would follow her about
      with my eyes; but when I found how much it embarrassed her, I pretended to
      be dozing when I heard her enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not understand how I came to be in Randall Carpenter&rsquo;s house. I
      dared not ask Vi or her husband; my presence implied too much already. I
      was afraid to ask the nurse; I did not know how much I should be telling
      by my question. There seemed to be a polite conspiracy of silence against
      me. I wondered where it would all end.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had grown to like the old doctor. He was a shrewd, wise, serious man. He
      never spoke a word of religion, yet he made his religion felt by his
      kindness. As he went about his work, he would become chatty, trying to
      rouse my interest. He spoke a good deal about himself and told me
      anecdotes of scenes which he had lived through in the War, when he had
      been a surgeon in the Northern army. Out of his old tired eyes he would
      watch me narrowly; I began to feel that he understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day I whispered to him to send away the nurse. He invented an errand
      for her, saying that he would stay with me till she returned. When she had
      gone, he closed the door carefully and came and sat down on the side of
      the bed. &ldquo;Now, what is it, my boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happened, doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pursed his lips judicially and looked away from me for a full minute,
      as though he would escape answering; then his eyes came back and I saw
      that he was going to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckoned you&rsquo;d be asking that question,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The morning that you figured to sail, you were taken sick at the Misses
      Januaries&rsquo;. You were mighty bad when they sent for me; you had pneumonia
      and a touch of brain-fever. It&rsquo;s a close call you&rsquo;ve had. I found you
      wandering in your head&mdash;and saying things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things, doctor? Things that I wouldn&rsquo;t want heard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded gravely. &ldquo;No one in Sheba knew anything about you. I saw that
      you were in for a long spell, and that the Misses Januaries&rsquo; was no place
      for you to get proper nursing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He halted awkwardly. &ldquo;Then I came to Randall and told him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had I mentioned him in my delirium?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d mentioned her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could feel the warm flush of color spreading through my body and turned
      away my head. The old doctor gripped my hand. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how it happened, I
      guess.&rdquo; Little by little he told me about Randall Carpenter. During the
      first days of crisis he had scarcely gone to bed, but had paced the house,
      always returning to my bedroom door to see if he could be of any service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, why should he care?&rdquo; I questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because she cared, I guess. He&rsquo;s so fond of her that he wants to do more
      than ever she could ask him. And then, Randall&rsquo;s a mighty just man, and
      he&rsquo;s always most just when he&rsquo;s most tempted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked down at me sidelong and silence fell between us. It was broken
      by the footfall of the nurse along the passage. I asked him quickly when I
      should be well enough to be moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re some better now, but we mustn&rsquo;t think of moving you yet, though,
      of course, you must go at the earliest.&rdquo; Towards midnight the nurse took
      my temperature. I saw that she was surprised, for she took it a second
      time. &ldquo;Have you any pain?&rdquo; she asked me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randall Carpenter came in and they went away together. I lay staring up at
      the ceiling, my hands clenched and my eyes burning. They all knew; I alone
      was ignorant of what things I had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      A carriage came bowling up the driveway. I recognized whose it was, for I
      had become familiar with the horse&rsquo;s step. The doctor came into the room;
      as he bent over me our eyes met. I clutched his arm and he stooped lower.
      &ldquo;Stay and talk with me,&rdquo; I whispered. &ldquo;You all look at me and none of you
      will tell me. I can&rsquo;t bear it&mdash;can&rsquo;t bear it any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can&rsquo;t you bear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not knowing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had told them that there was no change for the worse and had sent
      them back to bed, he came and sat down beside me. The lights in the room
      were extinguished, save for a reading lamp in a far corner where the nurse
      had been sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess something&rsquo;s troubling you. Take your time and tell me slowly.
      I&rsquo;ll sure help you, if I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor, you know about me and Mrs. Carpenter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;re sort of fond of her&mdash;is that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I buried my face against the cool pillow. I dared not look at him, but he
      signaled me courage with the pressure of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than fond, that&rsquo;s why I came to Sheba. I didn&rsquo;t mean to let her know
      that I&rsquo;d ever been here; that last evening we met by accident. I was a
      fool to have come. I&rsquo;ve been unfair to her&mdash;unfair to everybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer me; he could not deny my assertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember what you said this afternoon&mdash;that I let things out in
      my delirium. I want to know what they were. I&rsquo;ve been trying to remember;
      but it all comes wild and confused. Tell me, did I say anything that would
      make her ashamed of me&mdash;anything that would make her hate me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;Nothing that would make her hate you. Perhaps, that&rsquo;s
      the worst of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, anything that would damage her reputation? Was I brought here
      only to prevent strangers from listening to what I said, just as you&rsquo;d
      shut a mad dog up for safety?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In my feverish suspense, I gained sudden strength and raised myself up on
      my elbow to face him. He patted me gently on the shoulder, saying, &ldquo;Lie
      down; it&rsquo;s a sick man&rsquo;s fancy. You&rsquo;re guessing wide of the mark&mdash;it
      was nothing such as that.&rdquo; He tucked me up and smoothed out the sheets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now stay still and I&rsquo;ll tell you. You were calling for her when I came to
      you. At first we didn&rsquo;t know what you meant; then you mentioned Dorrie.
      Only Miss Priscilla and I heard what you were saying; you can trust Miss
      Priscilla not to speak about it. I let Randall know and he brought his
      wife over with him. Directly she touched you, you grew quiet. It was
      Randall suggested you being brought here; he was sorry for you and it was
      kindness made him do it. All through your illness till you came to
      yourself, Mrs. Carpenter sat by you; whenever she left you, you grew
      restless. She and her husband saved your life, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what makes them all so strange to me now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fidgeted and cleared his throat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the truth I&rsquo;m wanting,&rdquo; I urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Randall saw what she meant to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what you meant to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Against my will a wave of joy throbbed through me. I felt like sobbing
      from relief and happiness. Then a clear vision of the reality came to me&mdash;the
      great silent man who stared at me for hours, and the high-spirited woman,
      so suddenly grown timid, stealing in and out the room with averted eyes in
      pallid meekness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ought I to do?&rdquo; My voice choked me as I asked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned his wise, care-wrinkled face towards me gravely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      wondering,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing to do&mdash;ask God about it.
      You did wrong in coming&mdash;there&rsquo;s no disguising that. But the good
      God&rsquo;s spared you. He knows what He means you to do. I&rsquo;m an old fellow, and
      I&rsquo;ve seen a heap of suffering and trouble. I&rsquo;ve seen men die on the
      battlefield, and I&rsquo;ve seen &rsquo;em go under when it was least expected.
      I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;d have come through, if I hadn&rsquo;t believed God knew what
      He was doing. I guess if He&rsquo;d been lazy, like me and you, He&rsquo;d just have
      let you slip out, &lsquo;cause it seemed easiest. But He hasn&rsquo;t, and He knows
      why He hasn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;d just leave it in His hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Long after he had ceased to speak, I lay thinking of his words&mdash;thinking
      how simple life would be if God were exactly like this old man. Then I
      began to hope that He might be&mdash;a kind of doctor of sick souls, who
      would get up out of bed and come driving through the night without
      complaining, just to bring quiet to sinful people like myself. I closed my
      eyes, trying to think that God sat beside me. Some time must have elapsed,
      but when I looked round the doctor was still there. His head was bowed
      forward from his bent shoulders, nodding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re tired. I can sleep now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He awoke with a jerk. His last words to me before he left were, &ldquo;Just
      leave it in His hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From then on there was a changed atmosphere in the house. We had all been
      afraid of one another and of one another&rsquo;s misunderstandings.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dorrie had gone to bed, Vi would sit within the circle of the lamp
      and read to me while I lay back on my pillows in the shadows, watching how
      the gold light broke about her face and hands. She was always doing
      something, either reading or sewing, as though when we were alone she were
      afraid to trust herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening she said to me, &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t asked if there are any letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t expecting any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t expecting any! Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because none of my friends know that I&rsquo;ve come to Sheba.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew her face back from the lamp; her sewing fell from her hands. My
      words had reminded us both of the guilty situation which lay unchanged
      behind our present attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was she who broke the silence. &ldquo;When you were taken ill I wrote Ruthita
      and told her&mdash;and told her that you were being nursed in our house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She brought me my letters and then made an excuse to leave me to myself.
      My father had written; so had the Snow Lady. After expressing concern for
      my health, the tone of their letters became constrained and unnatural;
      they refrained from accusing me, but they had guessed. Ruthita&rsquo;s was an
      awkward, shamefaced little note&mdash;it puzzled me by omitting to say
      anything of Halloway.
    </p>
    <p>
      More and more after this Vi showed fear of being left alone with me; any
      moment a slip of the tongue might betray our passion. Frequently during
      the evening hours Mr. Carpenter would join us. He would steal into the
      room while Vi was reading and sit down by my bedside. I began to have
      great sympathy for the man. Vi&rsquo;s actions to him were those of a daughter,
      and he, when he addressed her, called her &ldquo;My child.&rdquo; Both their attitudes
      to one another were wrong&mdash;it hurt me to watch them; they made such
      efforts to create the impression that everything was well. Sitting beside
      me while she read, he would fasten his eyes on her. If she smiled across
      at him in turning a page, his heavy face would flood with a quite
      disproportionate joy. He was too fine a man for the part he was playing;
      he had strength of character and mastery over men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along his own lines he had a wonderful mind. It was always scheming for
      efficiency, concentration, and bigger projects. If money was the reward of
      his energy, the desire for power impelled him. But I could quite
      understand how a woman might yearn for more human interests and more
      subtle methods of conveying affection than the mere piling of luxury on
      luxury. He could articulate his deepest emotions only in acts.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening when Vi had excused herself on the ground that she had a
      headache, I took the opportunity to thank him for his kindness. He became
      as confused as if I had discovered him in a lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy, you mustn&rsquo;t speak to me like that; you don&rsquo;t owe me
      anything. It is I who owe you everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was staggered by his disclaimer. Under existing circumstances it seemed
      a superlative extravagance of language. Then he explained, &ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t
      been for you, we shouldn&rsquo;t have Vi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the first reference that any of us had made to what had happened at
      Ransby.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that Randall Carpenter and I grew to be friends. We didn&rsquo;t do much
      talking about it, but we each realized how the other felt....
    </p>
    <p>
      I was almost sufficiently recovered to travel. I broached the subject of
      my leaving several times&mdash;the first time at breakfast. Randall
      glanced up sharply from the letter he was opening&mdash;his expression
      clouded&mdash;instead of looking at me he stared at Vi. &ldquo;Certainly not.
      Certainly not,&rdquo; he blustered. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t hear of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dorrie added her piping protest. Vi alone was silent. Every time I
      approached the subject it was the same. The truth was our relations were
      so delicately balanced that the slightest disturbance would precipitate a
      crisis&mdash;and the crisis we dreaded. We each one knew that the time for
      frank speaking could scarcely be avoided, but we were eager to postpone
      it. So we procrastinated, lengthening out our respite.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon I returned with Randall from a drive to find Vi waiting for
      us at the gate. Her face was drawn with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; asked Randall, and the sharpness of suspense wa$ in his
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vi handed me a cable. It was my recall&mdash;we all knew that. I ripped
      the envelope in haste; what I read, strange to say, caused me no elation&mdash;only
      the bitterness of finality. I raised my eyes; they were both staring at
      me. &ldquo;My grandfather&rsquo;s dead. His will&rsquo;s in my favor. I must return to
      England immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They received the news as though a blow had fallen. Vi crept in and out
      the rooms with a masked expression of unspoken tragedy. Dorrie caused
      frequent embarrassment by her coaxing attempts to make me promise to visit
      them again. Nevertheless, when she had gone to bed and we no longer had
      her to distract us, we would pass more painful hours in inventing small
      talk to tide us over dangerous topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night before I sailed, we kept Dorrie up till she fell asleep against
      me. Her innocence was a barrier between us. When she had been carried to
      bed, Vi sat down to the piano and sang, while we two men glowered
      desperately before the fire. I dared not watch her; I could not bear the
      pain that was in her eyes. As I listened, I knew that her chief difficulty
      in selections was what to avoid. We were in a mood to read into everything
      a sentimental interpretation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were long pauses between her playing, during which no one spoke and
      the only sound to be heard was the falling of ashes in the grate. The way
      in which we were grouped seemed symbolic&mdash;she at the piano apart from
      us, while we were side by side; by loving her, we had pushed her out of
      both our lives. Randall turned querulously in his chair, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go
      on playing, my child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Several times she half-commenced an air and broke off. Her voice was a
      blind thing, tottering down an endless passage. For a horrid minute there
      was dead silence&mdash;quivering suspense; then the keys crashed
      discordantly as she gave way to a storm of weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose with an appealing gesture, and slipped out. We heard her
      footsteps trailing up the stairs, her door close, and then stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shuddered as though a window had been flung open behind me and a cold
      wind blew across my back. The man at my side huddled down into his chair;
      his fleshy face had lost its firmness; his eyes, like a statue&rsquo;s, seemed
      without pupils. The moment which we had dreaded and postponed had arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randall followed her into the hall; he came back, shutting the door
      carefully behind him. There was slow decision in his voice when he said,
      &ldquo;After all, we&rsquo;ve got to speak about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sank down, his cheeks blotchy and his hands quivering as with palsy.
      When he spoke, he tried to make his voice steady and matter-of-fact. It
      was as though he were saying, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to be commonsense, we men of the
      world. We knew this would happen. There&rsquo;s nothing to be gained by losing
      our nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This is what he actually said, &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t her fault. You and I are to
      blame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not you,&rdquo; I protested. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s I who&rsquo;ve behaved abominably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shifted in his chair; struck a match; raised it part way to his cigar
      and let it flicker out. Without looking at me he answered, &ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t gain
      anything by quarreling over who&rsquo;s to blame. We&rsquo;ve got her into a mess
      between us&mdash;it&rsquo;s up to us to get her out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He flung out his arm in irritation. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste words. I married her when
      she was too young to know what marriage meant; I loved her and supposed
      that nothing else mattered. That&rsquo;s my share. You made love to my wife and
      followed her to Sheba. That&rsquo;s yours. We&rsquo;ve got her into a mess between us,
      and we&rsquo;ve got to get her out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited for me to make a suggestion; I was too much taken aback. We
      couldn&rsquo;t get her out; we could only help her to endure it. We both knew
      that&mdash;so why discuss it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning his head and staring hard at me, he continued, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one
      thing to be considered&mdash;<i>her happiness</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps she&rsquo;ll forget when I&rsquo;m gone,&rdquo; I ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t and you know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He barked the words. His manner was losing its air of tired patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Cardover, you and I have got to get down to facts. We don&rsquo;t
      help one another by fooling ourselves. You went out of her life for a
      year; she didn&rsquo;t forget It&rsquo;s different now; you&rsquo;ve been with her in this
      house and everything will remind her of you. What are we going to do about
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He repeated his question harshly, as though demanding an instant answer.
      What could I tell him?
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke the miserable silence. &ldquo;Ever since you talked of leaving, I&rsquo;ve
      been studying this thing out. I knew we&rsquo;d have to face it, and yet somehow
      I hoped&mdash;&mdash; Never mind what I hoped. So you&rsquo;ve nothing to say?
      You can&rsquo;t guess what I&rsquo;m driving at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face became haggard and stern; only the twitching of the eye-lids
      betrayed his nervousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give anything to see Vi happy. So would you&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that
      correct?&rdquo; He darted a challenging look in my direction. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give all I
      possess, I say, factories, banks, good name, popularity. She&rsquo;s more to me
      than anything in the world.&rdquo; Then reluctantly forcing himself to speak the
      words, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one way out&mdash;only one way to make her happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leant forward, clutching my knee. &ldquo;You must have her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I drew back from him amazed, startled out of my self-possession. There was
      something so horribly commonsense about his offer; I could not take him
      seriously for the moment. He was tempting me, perhaps, in order that he
      might find out just how far Vi and I had gone together&mdash;he might
      easily suspect that things had happened during that summer at Ransby which
      had not been confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now as I met his cold gray eyes, I felt his power. His face was
      inscrutable and set, his mouth relentless. I had often wondered as I had
      watched him in his home-life what stern qualities his amiability disguised&mdash;qualities
      which would account for his business success. I knew now: here was a man
      who could state facts in their nudity and strip problems of their
      sentiment&mdash;a man who could lay aside feeling and act with the cruelty
      of logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have her,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Randall,&rdquo; I broke out hoarsely, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t mean that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do mean it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t allow it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;d have to if I forced her; when I&rsquo;d forced her, she&rsquo;d be glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s impossible. It isn&rsquo;t honorable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honorable! If we&rsquo;d been honorable, you and I, this wouldn&rsquo;t have
      happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But think what people would say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What people would say doesn&rsquo;t matter. There are some things which go so
      deep that they concern only ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Vi&mdash;before ever we decide anything, it would be honest to
      consult her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had her decision to-night.&rdquo; He spoke bitterly, with settled finality.
      &ldquo;You see it&rsquo;s this way: I&rsquo;ve tried to make her happy; because of you I
      never shall. She wants you; she&rsquo;s a right to have you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fire had all but gone out; the room had grown chilly. We sat without
      talking, thinking of her, reviewing the brutal cruelties of life. I had
      reached the logical goal of my desire&mdash;the impossible had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      I let my fancy run a little way ahead, picturing the first freshness of
      the days that were coming. Far away, with faery sounds, bugles of the
      future were blowing. I was recalled to the ominous present by the frozen
      hopelessness of this just man. We were placing society at defiance; we
      were settling our problem on grounds of individual expediency. Would we
      have strength to be happy in spite of condemnation? Would our conception
      of what was just to Vi prove just in the end?
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to waver. I thought I saw what had happened to Randall&mdash;the
      tension of the last weeks had wrought upon his nerves. He had brooded over
      the situation till remorse for his own share in it had made him lose his
      regard for social standards. There was a tinge of insanity about this
      quixotic determination to sacrifice himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went over to the fireplace and pulled the smoldering logs together, so
      that they broke into a feeble flame. I did it leisurely to gain time. With
      my back towards him I inquired, &ldquo;Have you reckoned the cost of all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the cost to yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have. You wouldn&rsquo;t propose it if you had. You know what&rsquo;ll be
      said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll be said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you wanted to get rid of her and that that was why you took me into
      your house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me out of it. If love means anything, it means sacrifice. I love
      her; you&rsquo;ve come between us. My love&rsquo;s injuring her now, and I&rsquo;m not going
      to see you spoil her life by going away without her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she&rsquo;ll spoil her life if she goes with me. People&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People! Well, what&rsquo;ll they say about her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything defiling that hasn&rsquo;t occurred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And <i>you</i> think that we ought to keep her miserable just because of
      that&mdash;out of fear of tittle-tattle? If she stays with me she&rsquo;ll be
      wretched; I shall have to watch myself torturing her&mdash;paining her
      even with my affection. If she goes with you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she goes with me she&rsquo;ll become a social outcast. She couldn&rsquo;t bear
      that; she&rsquo;d sink under it. No, Randall, we can&rsquo;t decide this matter as if
      it concerned only ourselves. It doesn&rsquo;t. There are all kinds of things
      involved in it. I&rsquo;ve been your guest, and you&rsquo;ve become my friend. We&rsquo;d
      look low-down in other people&rsquo;s eyes. You want her to be happy&mdash;none
      of us could ever be that if we did what you suggest. Don&rsquo;t you see that
      you&rsquo;d be the only one who was playing a decent part? Vi&rsquo;s part and mine
      would be contemptible. We&rsquo;d appear treacherous even to ourselves. As for
      other people&mdash;&mdash;!! You take me into your house when I&rsquo;m sick,
      and I run off with your wife! It can&rsquo;t be done, Randall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m proposing,&rdquo; he said quietly; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to
      run away together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll arrange that she shall divorce me. I&rsquo;ve consulted lawyers. According
      to the laws of Massachusetts an absolute divorce, which would permit you
      to marry her within a reasonable time, is only granted on one ground. I&rsquo;ll
      provide her with fictitious evidence. She can bring the case against me
      and I&rsquo;ll let it go uncontested. She can win her freedom respectably
      without your name being mentioned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My position was elaborately false. I wanted her with every atom of my
      body, and here was I contending that I would not have her. At Ransby I had
      been willing to steal her, and now she was offered me; but I had not seen
      how much she meant to Randall then&mdash;at that time he was a hostile
      figure in my imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      His unselfishness filled me with shame that I had ever thought to wrong
      him. And yet the thing which he proposed was the inevitable consequence of
      our actions; his cold reasoning had discerned that. If facts were as he
      had stated them, what other way was there out?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You agree, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;d save our faces for us, but what d&rsquo;you suppose we&rsquo;d think
      of ourselves? The thing&rsquo;s not decent. People don&rsquo;t do things like that.
      Men can run off with other men&rsquo;s wives and still respect themselves; if
      they did what you suggest&mdash;take the husband&rsquo;s happiness and his good
      name as well&mdash;they&rsquo;d know what to call themselves, though no one else
      suspected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blackguards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So in your opinion it&rsquo;s worse to take a wife with her husband&rsquo;s consent
      than to steal her? Humph!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leant across the table for a cigar. With great deliberation he cut the
      end. When it was well alight, he thrust his thumbs into his waistcoat
      pockets, looking me up and down. When he spoke, he left gaps between his
      words. There was the rumble of suppressed anger in what he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were a strong man, Cardover, or I shouldn&rsquo;t have spoken to
      you the way I have. You fell in love with my wife without knowing she was
      married; I don&rsquo;t blame you for that. But after you knew, you followed her&mdash;followed
      her to her home-town. You&rsquo;ve made an impossible situation. You can&rsquo;t leave
      it at that; you&rsquo;ve got to help out, and, by God, you shall. I&rsquo;ve got to
      lose her and stand the disgrace of it. You&rsquo;ve got to lose your
      self-respect. What d&rsquo;you think life is, anyhow? If you gamble, you incur
      debts. We&rsquo;re going to play this game to a finish. You talk of decency and
      honor; you should have thought of them earlier. You came here to rob me of
      my wife; well, now I&rsquo;m going to give her to you because she can&rsquo;t do
      without you. And now, out of consideration for me, you want to crawl out
      at the last minute. Your crawling out may save appearances, but it don&rsquo;t
      alter facts. You&rsquo;re something worse than a blackguard&mdash;a quitter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew in his breath as if he were about to strike; then he flung out his
      fist, shaking it at me. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I want her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s the matter? Are you afraid of the price?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The price she&rsquo;d have to pay and you&rsquo;d have to pay&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He frowned. His face was puckered with suspicion. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it that you&rsquo;re
      afraid for yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The heat of his anger scorched me. I had watched this interpretation of my
      conduct taking shape under my repeated refusals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been accused of counting the cost before to-day,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
      counting the cost now. I&rsquo;m thinking of Vi with her clean standards and her
      sense of duty. If she were the woman to consent to what you&rsquo;re proposing,
      I wouldn&rsquo;t want to marry her and you wouldn&rsquo;t be willing to sacrifice
      yourself for her. But she won&rsquo;t consent, and I won&rsquo;t consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lurching heavily to his feet, he stood over me threateningly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
      know I can force you? If I divorced her you&rsquo;d have to marry her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I would if I thought it was only for my sake you were refusing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only partly for your sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve shared your hospitality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And because of that you won&rsquo;t take her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll make you&mdash;&mdash; For the last time, will you take her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on those terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Our voices had risen. A silence followed. Behind us we heard a sound. The
      temperature of the room seemed lowered, as though something we had killed
      had entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning, we saw Vi standing in the doorway. Her hair fell loose about her
      shoulders. She was thinly clad and had risen hastily from bed. Our quarrel
      must have reached her through the silent house. Her face was pinched and
      pitiful. As she watched us her eyes searched Randall&rsquo;s in terror and her
      hands plucked at her breasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      How much had she heard? How long had she been standing there? Did she know
      how we had been degrading her? What had she gathered from my last words?
      She had found us haggling over her as though she were a chattel, each one
      trying to force the other to accept her, neither showing any sign that he
      desired her for himself. In the chilly room we shivered, hanging our
      heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly she crossed the room. Her eyes were fixed on Randall; for all the
      attention she paid me, I might not have been there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t mean it. You can&rsquo;t have meant it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his head weakly, in one last effort to be firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I did, Vi. It&rsquo;s for your sake&mdash;for your happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flung her arms about him, holding him to her though he tried to draw
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you forgot&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did&mdash;there&rsquo;s Dorrie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She buried her head on his shoulder, sobbing her heart out. He eyed me
      sullenly. He looked an old man. Awkwardly, with a gesture that was afraid
      of its tenderness, he let his hand wander across her hair. She raised her
      face to his, clinging against him, and kissed him on the mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      They traversed the room, going from me; their footsteps died out upon the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never once had she looked at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the grayness of the morning, before the servants had begun to stir, I
      packed my bag and left.

      CHAPTER I&mdash;THE HOME-COMING
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>eaving the hansom
      at the foot of Pope Lane and carrying my bags, I walked up the avenue of
      limes. The wantonness of spring was in the air and its melancholy. Above
      the high walls the golden hurry of the sunset quivered. A breeze tore past
      me down the passage, twisting and turning like a madcap ballet-dancer.
      Overhead in the young greenness of the trees a host of sparrows fluttered,
      impudently publishing their love-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Plymouth on landing I had been met by letters from my lawyers and from
      Uncle Obad. They were addressed to Sir Dante Cardover. It was rather
      pleasant to be addressed as Sir Dante; until then I had not realized my
      luck. The memory of that last night at Sheba had numbed my faculties and
      taken my future from me. But now, with the thought of Woadley, life began
      to weave itself into a new pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the run up to London, as the quiet of English landscapes and the
      greenness of English meadows drifted by, I lost my bitter sense of
      isolation: I belonged to this; it was part of me. At the same time, the
      impassive wholesomeness of English faces awoke me in a strange way to the
      enormity of what I had done. It was odd how far I had wandered from old
      traditions and old landmarks in the delirium of the past two years. Even I
      was a little scandalized by some of my recollections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day I purposed to go down to Woadley; to-night I would spend with my
      father at Pope Lane. There were explanations to be made; explanations
      where my father was concerned, were never comfortable. I walked with a
      pebble in my shoe till I had got them over. I had sure proof that he was
      annoyed, for none of my letters, written to him since my recovery, had
      been answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thrusting my hand into the creeper, I found the knob. Far away at the back
      of the house the bell tinkled; after an interval footsteps shuffled down
      the path. The door opened cautiously; in the slit it made I saw the face
      of Hetty. There was something in-its expression that warned me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father at home?&rdquo; I asked cheerfully, pushing forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master Dante, or Sir Dante as I should say, don&rsquo;t you go for to see &rsquo;im.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s bitter against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense! Here, take one of these bags. Why should he be bitter
      against me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She crumpled her apron nervously. &ldquo;&lsquo;Cause of &rsquo;er&mdash;the woman in
      Ameriky. I don&rsquo;t know the rights of it, but &rsquo;e&rsquo;s &rsquo;ardly
      spoke your name since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve come to see him. I&rsquo;ve only just landed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stared at me gloomily, barring the entrance. Across her shoulder I
      could see the path winding round the house and down to the garden where
      everything was familiar. Once I had longed to leave it! How much I would
      now give to get back! The leaves shivered, making patches of sunlight move
      like gold checkers, pushed forward and backward on the lawn. My mind
      keenly visualized all the details that lay out of sight. I knew just how
      my father must look sitting writing at his study-window. I ought to have
      told him; he might have understood. But the barrier of reticence had
      always divided us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I was you, Sir Dante, I&rsquo;d go away and write &rsquo;im. I&rsquo;ll see that
      &rsquo;e reads it this time. Yes I will, if I loses my plaice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>This time?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her cheeks went crimson. &ldquo;&rsquo;E didn&rsquo;t read the letters you sent after
      &rsquo;ers. &rsquo;E tossed &rsquo;em aside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Snow Lady and Ruthie, they&rsquo;ll see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked furtively over her shoulder at the house, then she slipped out
      into the lane beside me, almost closing the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no Miss Ruthie now,&rdquo; she said sadly. Then, in a voice which
      betrayed pride, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s Lady Halloway. &rsquo;Is Lordship, &rsquo;e were
      a wery &rsquo;ot lover, &rsquo;e were&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t take no for an
      answer and suchlike. After you&rsquo;d gone away angry and no one knew where
      you&rsquo;d gone, Miss Ruthie felt kind o&rsquo; flat; but she kept on sayin&rsquo; no to
      &lsquo;is Lordship, though she was always cryin&rsquo;. Then that letter came from
      Americky. It kind o&rsquo; took us by surprise; Miss Ruthie especially. We felt&mdash;well,
      you know, sir&mdash;disrespectable. So she gave way like, and now she&rsquo;s
      Lady Halloway. And there you are. We&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad a &rsquo;eap of
      trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little Ruthie the wife of that man! I had made them unrespectable, so she
      had rectified my mistake by marrying the father of Lottie&rsquo;s child!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had edged herself into the garden and held the door at closing-point.
      I could see the house no longer. Her head looked out through the slit as
      though it had no body. I was sick and angry&mdash;angry because of
      Ruthita. Anger restored my determination. They should not condemn me
      without a hearing; their morality was stucco-fronted&mdash;a cheap
      imitation of righteousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pushed roughly past Hetty like an insolent peddler, and left her
      bleating protests behind. In the hall I dropped my bags and entered my
      father&rsquo;s study unannounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced up from under the hand with which his eyes were shaded. His
      mouth straightened. He went on with his writing, feigning that he had not
      heard me enter. I remembered the trick well&mdash;as a boy it had made
      punishment the more impressive. It was done for that purpose now; he had
      never accustomed himself to think of me as a grown man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I watched him. How lean, and threadbare, and overworked he looked! How he
      tyrannized over himself! The hair had grown thin about the temples; his
      eyes were weak, his forehead lined. He had disciplined joy out of his
      life. But there was something big about him&mdash;a stern forcefulness of
      character which came of long years of iron purpose. He had failed, but he
      would not acknowledge his failure. All these years his daily routine of
      drudgery had remained unchanged. Outside the spring was stirring, just as
      it had stirred in his children&rsquo;s lives. But his windows were shut against
      the spring because he had to earn his daily bread. The anger I had felt
      turned to pity. He was so lonely in his strength. Had he been weaker, he
      would have been happier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not want to see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He blotted his page carefully and laid aside his pen. &ldquo;I had good reason.&rdquo;
       His voice was cold and tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t judge of that; you haven&rsquo;t heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can conjecture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have at least the right to explain. You can&rsquo;t conjecture the
      details that led up to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These things are usually led up to by the same details. All I know is
      that any meeting between us now can only cause pain, and I cannot afford
      to be upset. You have your standards of honor; I have mine. Evidently they
      are divergent. You didn&rsquo;t give me your confidence before you sailed; I
      don&rsquo;t invite it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had allowed me to remain standing, making me feel my intrusion on his
      privacy. I had always felt that in talking to him I was keeping him from
      his work. My mind went back to the fear with which I had entered his study
      in the old days. And this was the end of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can never have cared much for me,&rdquo; I threw out bitterly, &ldquo;if you can
      break with me so lightly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His pale face flushed; his distant manner broke down. &ldquo;How should you know
      how much I cared?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I know! All my life you&rsquo;ve been silent and there were times&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He interrupted. &ldquo;It is because I cared so much. I was so anxious for you
      and wanted you to do so well. I&rsquo;m not demonstrative. I always hoped that
      we might be friends. But you never came to me with your troubles from a
      little chap, anyone was better than your father&mdash;-servants, your
      Uncle Spreckles, Ruthita, anybody. With me you were dumb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never encouraged my confidence and now you condemn me unheard.
      Silence between us has become a habit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stabbed the blotting-paper with his pen. His emotions were stirred; he
      was afraid he might betray them. So he spoke hurriedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late to
      cover old ground. We&rsquo;ve drifted apart, that&rsquo;s certain&mdash;and now this
      has happened... this disgrace... this adultery of thoughts... this lust
      for a married woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I walked across to the window and drummed upon the panes. Across the
      garden a soft gray dusk was falling. Along those paths Ruthita and I had
      played; the garden was empty and very lonely. Scene after scene came back,
      made kindly by distance. I turned. &ldquo;Father, I&rsquo;m not going to let you turn
      me out until you know all about it. For the first time you&rsquo;ve told me
      frankly that you wanted me. I was always frightened as a little chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead of taking me up angrily as I expected, he spoke gently. &ldquo;Why
      shouldn&rsquo;t I want you? I thought you&rsquo;d understand by the way I worked. Sit
      down, boy; why are you standing? How... how did it happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Snow Lady rapped on the door and almost entered. My father signed to
      her to go away, saying that we would come to her later. Then I told him.
      And while I told him I kept thinking how strange it was that until now,
      when we had quarreled, we should never have found one another, but, like
      two people eager to meet, had walked always at the same pace, in the same
      direction, out of sight, round and round on opposite sides of the same
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dark when I finished. He leant out and laid his hand on my arm.
      &ldquo;And now that it&rsquo;s all ended, we can make a new start together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may not be all ended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is. You&rsquo;re not going to tell me that you&rsquo;re still hankering after
      a married woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The kindness went from his voice. He rang the bell, waited in silence till
      Hetty brought the lamp, and took it from her at the door to prevent her
      entering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say it isn&rsquo;t ended, this criminal folly. I can&rsquo;t conceive what you
      mean by it. One of these days you&rsquo;ll drag my name through the dirt. There
      are other people to consider besides yourself. There&rsquo;s Ruthita&mdash;her
      husband&rsquo;s sensitive already. In fact, he doesn&rsquo;t want to meet you, and he
      doesn&rsquo;t want you to meet her. What it comes to is this: we can&rsquo;t be
      friends unless you give this woman up absolutely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not possible. Randall threatened to divorce her. If he does, it will
      be that I may marry her. I shall have to marry her, and I shall be jolly
      glad to marry her. What has happened since I left I can&rsquo;t tell. Until I
      know, I hold myself prepared. So I can&rsquo;t promise anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The choice is between her and your family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I choose her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then until you&rsquo;ve come to your senses, there can be no communication
      between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down noisily at his desk. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse me; there&rsquo;s nothing more
      to be said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I still waited, he took up his pen. &ldquo;I have an article here that I
      must get finished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I walked slowly down the lane. The door swung to behind me. I felt that I
      was seeing this for the last time. All the old, trivial, sweet
      associations came thronging back: the dying affections, the lost innocence
      which had seemed so permanent, stretched out hands to restrain me. Even
      Hetty had condemned; it was written in her face. Long ago Hetty and I had
      viewed the world from the same angle, we had criticised and schemed
      against our tyrants together. The chapter of home life was ended. Whatever
      happened as regards Vi, there could be no going back.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II&mdash;DREAM HAVEN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> did not go to
      Woadley as I had planned. My position was too uncertain at present for me
      to venture where further explanations would be required. My father had
      made me aware of that. I was unwilling to cover the same ground of
      argument with Grandmother Cardover, so I had my lawyers visit me in
      London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until something had been definitely settled, I did not care to return to
      Oxford or to seek out any of my friends; I should at once be called upon
      to account for my erratic departure and prolonged absence. So I made
      myself inconspicuous in the crowds of London, waiting for some final word
      from Sheba. It was quite likely that none would ever come&mdash;and that
      would be an answer in itself. Yet, now that I had done what had seemed to
      me right and had thrust her from me, I hoped against hope that, somehow,
      she might come back. I felt that though I might have to wait for years, I
      would resolutely wait for her. No other woman could ever take her place.
      And none of this could I tell her. She might think that I had counted the
      cost and considered it too expensive. She might put the worst construction
      on the words she had overheard on that last night; yet unless she
      approached me first, I was irrevocably pledged to silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too late for my peace of mind I recognized my weakness: if I had wanted
      her, I should have taken her strongly in the early days and faced the
      consequences; now, through making truces with my conscience and
      conventions, I had lived so long in thoughts of her that I should always
      desire her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would like to have gone to Ruthita, but that was forbidden. Lord
      Halloway riding the high horse of morality was exceedingly comic, but I
      knew exactly how men of his stamp argued: to introduce a questionable
      relation into the family was anathema. I wondered continually what secret
      causes lay behind Ruthita&rsquo;s marriage. I felt sure that she had consented
      on the impulse, and that love had had nothing to do with it. The suspicion
      that I was somehow responsible left me worried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spring had reached the point of perfection where it merges into summer.
      The tides of life flowed strongly through the dazzling streets of London;
      I was too young not to respond to their energy. Everywhere the persistent
      hope of spring planted banners of green and set them waving. Ragged shrubs
      in decrepit squares bubbled into blossom. Window-boxes lent a touch of
      braveness. Water-carts passed up and down parched streets, settling the
      dust. In the kind of suburb that walks always with a hole in its stocking,
      slatternly maids pressed their bosoms against area-railings chaffing with
      butcher-boy or policeman&mdash;their idea of love. Where a street-organ
      struck up, little children gathered, dancing in the gutter. Even the
      sullen Thames, the gray hair of London, was dyed to gold between the
      bridges by the splendid sun. The spirit of youth had invaded the city;
      flower-girls, shouting raucously above the traffic, shaking their posies
      in the face of every comer, seemed heralds of a new cheerfulness, shaming
      Despair of his defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This severing of oneself from friendship was dull. Leisurely crowds
      laughing along sunlit pavements, made me ache for companionship. I was in
      this frame of mind when I chanced to think of Uncle Obad&rsquo;s letter. It had
      met me at Plymouth on my arrival, and bore the characteristically
      flamboyant address of <i>Dream Haven, Dorking.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      He must have chosen Dorking as a place of residence because it had given
      its name to a famous breed of fowls. Perhaps he thought such a
      neighborhood would be propitious to his own experiments. His letter was
      brief and to the point: if I could spare the time, he and Aunt Lavinia
      would feel honored to entertain me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Obad was stilted in his written use of language; he felt <i>honored</i>
      when he meant to say <i>jolly well glad</i>. There was always an obedient
      servant ring about the way in which he signed himself. The training he had
      undergone as secretary to charitable societies had spoilt him for familiar
      letter-writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the Rapson incident, things had never been quite the same. My good
      fortune made him uneasy; it placed a gap between us and, I suppose, served
      to emphasize his non-success. Of his new mode of life since the Christian
      Boarding House had been abandoned, I had only heard. The thought of him
      had lain a dusty memory at the back of my mind&mdash;which made it all the
      kinder that he should now remember me. Perhaps he had heard before writing
      of how Pope Lane had planned to receive me.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I steamed into the station I hung my head out of the window to catch
      first sight of him. Yes, there he was. He had grown stouter; his purple
      whiskers which still bristled like shaving-brushes, had faded to a milky
      white. He was wearing a long fawn dust-coat which flapped about the calves
      of his legs. He carried the old exaggerated air of blustering importance,
      but was a trifle more careless in his dress. His carelessness, however,
      was now the prosperous untidiness of one who could afford it. In his lapel
      he wore a scarlet geranium.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I stepped out, he came fussily towards me. &ldquo;Very good of you to come,
      I&rsquo;m sure&mdash;kind and very thoughtful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was his pretense manner&mdash;the one he adopted with grown-ups. I
      wanted to remind him that with me he could take off his armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still go in for breeding hens?&rdquo; I asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face brightened. &ldquo;I should say so. Our little place is quite a
      menagerie. We&rsquo;ve cats, and dogs, and rabbits, and a parrot. And hens!
      Well, I should say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>And hens</i>,&rdquo; I laughed. &ldquo;Remember the old white hen you gave me? It
      laid one egg and then ate it; after that it died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should have given it gravel or oyster-shells.&rdquo; Poultryraising was a
      subject he never treated lightly. He fussed along beside me, explaining
      with his old enthusiasm the mysterious ways of fowls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the station a dog-cart was standing, with a fat little piebald
      pony between the shafts. We stuffed the baggage under the back-seat, and
      squeezed into the front together. The pony started off at a smart trot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;you know what this reminds me of?&mdash;That first day we spent
      together. You remember&mdash;when you drove me away from Pope Lane behind
      Dollie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pulled out his handkerchief and trumpeted. His eyes became dreamy
      beneath his bushy brows. &ldquo;A long time ago! They were good days, but not as
      good as these, old chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We fell to remembering. The pony slowed down to a walk. How everything
      came back as we talked! And how ripping the old Spuffler had always been,
      and how ripping it was to be near him now! He had put aside his armor of
      pretense and was talking naturally. We talked together of that first day
      when we had met the gipsies in the Surrey woodland, and we talked of the
      Red House, and of all the times that we had been happy. A warm wind
      fluttered about us. I caught Uncle Obad looking at me fixedly, dropping
      his eyes and then looking up again, as though he were trying to satisfy
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That <i>Sir</i> don&rsquo;t seem to have spoiled you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The red walls of Dorking were left behind. A white chalky road stretched
      before us, climbing upward to the skyey downs; over to the left rose a
      wooded ridge, somnolent with pines; to the right lay a village-common
      across which geese waddled in solemn procession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Obad roused himself and shook the reins. &ldquo;This won&rsquo;t buy a pair of
      shoes for the baby. Aunt Lavinia&rsquo;s waiting for us; she&rsquo;s just as keen as I
      was to see whether: you&rsquo;ve altered.&rdquo; Then to the pony, &ldquo;Gee-up, Toby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We turned off into the pine-wood by a narrow roadway. The fragrance of
      balsam made me long to close my eyes. At the edge of the road, on either
      side, ran a ditch through which water tinkled over gravel. On its banks
      grew fern and foxglove. The silent aisles of the wood were carpeted with
      the tan of fallen needles. Sunlight, drifting between branches, slashed
      golden rags in the olive-tinted shadows. My mind became a blank through
      pure enjoyment as I listened to the monologue of gay chatter that was
      going on beside me. He was doing for me now just what he had done for me
      so often as a child, throwing down the walls of conventional tyrannies and
      showing me the road of escape to nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly out of the basking stillness rose a farmyard clamor&mdash;cocks
      crowing, ducks quacking, and the boastful clucking of hens. We had reached
      the top of the ridge and were bowling along the level. Toby pricked up his
      ears and quickened his trotting. Round a bend we swung into sight of a
      low-thatched house, standing in a clearing. Its windows were leaded and
      opened outwards. In front grew a garden, sun-saturated, riotous with
      flowers, and partly hidden by a high hawthorn hedge. In the hedge was a
      white swing-gate, from which a red-brick path ran up to the threshold.
      Across the gate one had a glimpse of beehives standing a-row; the air was
      heavy with mingled scents of pine, wild thyme, and honey. The impression
      that fastened on my imagination was one of exquisite cleanliness: the sky,
      the gleaming chalk road, the white-painted woodwork of the cottage,
      everything was dazzlingly spotless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our wheels had hardly halted before the gate, when I saw Aunt Lavinia in
      the doorway unfastening her apron. Neat and methodical as ever, she folded
      it carefully, and laid it on a chair before coming out to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lavinia, Lavinia! We&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; shouted Uncle Obad.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came down the path, prim and unhurried, determined not to let herself
      go. &ldquo;Repose is refinement&rdquo; she used to tell me. Nothing in her manner was
      ruffled. She still carried herself with a certain grave air of sweet
      authority. The rustle of her starched print-dress gave her an atmosphere
      of nurse-like austerity. She had not changed, save that the look of worry
      had gone from her face, and her eyes were untired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s glad I am to see you.&rdquo; She spoke quietly and, when she kissed me,
      was careful not to crumple her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dignified and graceful&mdash;that&rsquo;s her,&rdquo; said Uncle Obad.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had plenty to talk about while we were getting over our first
      strangeness. I had to see the house and all its arrangements. My room was
      at the back, looking out from the ridge over smoking tree-tops far away
      across undulating downs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Windows and doors were always open, so the passages were blowy with the
      dreamy, drowsy smell of green things growing. Creepers tumbled across
      sills; leaves tapped whenever the breeze stirred them; pigeons flew into
      the dining-room at meal-times and perched on Uncle Obad&rsquo;s shoulder.
      Usually everything within a house is man-made. At Dream Haven Nature was
      encouraged to tiptoe across the threshold; so bees entered humming, and
      blackbirds came for grain to the windows, and all day long the wild things
      were sending their ambassadors. Beating wings of birds and cooing of doves
      filled one&rsquo;s ears with the peace and adventure of contentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the recreations of Dream Haven, but its stern business, as one
      might suppose, was the raising of fowls. At the back of the cottage on a
      southern slope were arranged coops, and pens, and houses, gleaming white
      against the golden gravel like a miniature military encampment. Each pen
      had its trumpeter, who strode forth at intervals to raise his challenge;
      whereupon every male in camp tried to outdo him, from the youngest
      stripling, whose shrill falsetto broke like a boy&rsquo;s voice in the middle,
      to the deep, rich tones of the oldest campaigner. Falsetto, tenor, bass,
      baritone shook the stillness like an army on the march, with rattle of
      accoutrements, and brass-bands playing, <i>cock-a-doodle-doo,
      cock-a-doodle-doo</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hush that followed from far away, as from scattered detachments
      replying, came the counter-sign. Below the ridge in the village on the
      downs every rooster felt his reputation endangered. In farmhouses out of
      sight the challenge was caught up and the boast flung back. To one
      listening intently, the clamor could be heard spreading across the
      countryside till it spent itself at last in the hazy distance. Then the
      ladies of the camp commenced their flatteries, <i>tuck-tuck-tuck-tuck-tuck-tuck,
      our men did best, our men did best</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Obad took childish delight in the comedy; he knew the voice of each
      male bird in his yard and the sequence of precedence in which they should
      aspire. If they got out of order, he would recognize at once which
      cockerel was trying to oust his senior. If the ambitious fellow was one of
      his experiments in crossing strains, he was vastly tickled. To him they
      all had their personalities; he used to say that a poultry-yard could
      teach you a whole lot about humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you men go out for a walk?&rdquo; said Aunt Lavinia; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Dante
      would like to look about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She knew that we had always had our secrets. It was seven o&rsquo;clock; there
      were still some hours of daylight. We set off through the poultry-runs
      down the hillside till we came to the edge of the clearing; Uncle Obad
      looked round furtively to make sure that we were unobserved, then he
      beckoned and slipped behind a shed. There he sat down with his back
      against the warm wooden wall and we lit our pipes. &ldquo;She makes me take
      exercise now,&rdquo; he grunted between puffs; &ldquo;thinks I&rsquo;m getting fat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps she&rsquo;s right. Aunt Lavinia&rsquo;s always been right ever since I can
      remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say so. She doesn&rsquo;t look it, but she&rsquo;s always worn the trousers,
      and small blame to her. But she was wrong once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When was that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He narrowed his eyes and watched the smoke curl up into the velvet air.
      When it had drifted a few yards away, one could imagine that it was a
      galleon &lsquo;cloud sailing slowly through infinity. I got to thinking how much
      more picturesque the world becomes when we lose our standards of
      perspective. Uncle Obad had won his happiness by making small things
      important to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer my question. I was too lazy to trouble him again. The
      rich spicy fragrance of woodlands lulled my senses. I watched through a
      gap in the trees how the sun&rsquo;s rays shortened across the downs. All the
      out-door world was bathed in tepid light. The fierceness had gone out of
      the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Spuffler always made me philosophize; he was a failure, but he had
      found a secret. He had known how to discover nooks and crannies in the
      persistent present where he could be content. I had lost that fine faculty
      for carelessness since I had grown older.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knocked out his pipe and commenced to refill it. &ldquo;But she wasn&rsquo;t always
      right,&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;I may be only an old knacker, but once I was righter
      than her.&mdash;What d&rsquo;you think of all this?&rdquo; He jerked his thumb across
      his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the last word... just what we always dreamt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I called it Dream Haven. Not so bad for a man of my years
      after keeping a Christian Boarding House!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make it pay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet. Don&rsquo;t need to, by Golly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t need to! How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business knowledge. Sound judgment. Backing my opinion when the odds were
      against me. I doubled up my fists and stood square against the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A kind of brave Horatius?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kept the bridge or something. Was a friend of Macaulay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never heard of him. Did he keep poultry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May have done; he was the kind of man who&rsquo;d keep anything he laid his
      hands on. But how the dickens d&rsquo;you hang on to this place if it isn&rsquo;t
      paying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got money. Got money to burn. Got enough to last me to my journey&rsquo;s end
      without earning a penny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was a small boy boasting. What a lot of fun he&rsquo;d have extracted from
      being Squire of Woadley. I wished I might learn how to spuffle; it so
      multiplied one&rsquo;s opportunities for pleasure. But I couldn&rsquo;t get as excited
      as he expected; I had heard him talk this way before on a certain day at
      Richmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you make it out of the boarding-house?&rdquo; I inquired incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed deep down in his throat. &ldquo;Not exactly. I received an envelope
      one morning; inside was a slip of paper on which was written &lsquo;<i>Compensation
      for a damaged character</i>&rsquo; There was no address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there must have been more than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet. There was a banker&rsquo;s draft. How much for? Guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five thousand pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoof! One of your charitable bigwigs sent it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not half. Came from Rapson. That&rsquo;s what comes of sticking to your
      friends. That&rsquo;s why I say that your Aunt wasn&rsquo;t always wiser than the poor
      old knacker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mines?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he said. He&rsquo;s been to see me since then. The way your Aunt Lavinia
      treated him was as funny as a cock without feathers.&mdash;I always
      believed in Rapson.&mdash;He had a bad streak though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He passed over my slur. &ldquo;Women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I meant. He&rsquo;s sorry now; wishes he&rsquo;d married her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! If you don&rsquo;t make your place pay, what are you doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face took on an expression of intense earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Breeding the Spreckles. Remember them, don&rsquo;t you? I had terrible work at
      first; couldn&rsquo;t make the strain permanent; in the third and fourth
      generations it was always going back to the original crossings. Well, now
      I&rsquo;ve done it. Come and look at &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old bond was established. His enthusiasm and my response to it swept
      aside the misunderstandings of years. I seemed a little boy, following him
      into a retreat of impossible glamour. He showed me a pen of magnificent
      slate-blue fowls; they had the extra toe of the Dorking, the drooping comb
      of the Leghorn, yellow legs of the Game, and full plump body of the
      Plymouth Rock. He enumerated their merits, insisted that I should guess
      what mixings of blood had gone to their making, and was delighted when he
      found I had not forgotten the old knowledge he had taught me. He was going
      to enter them at the shows this year, but he was worried over one point&mdash;what
      name should he call them?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve given them their name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know, old chap; but my conscience troubles me. Yer see, I
      shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to do it if it hadn&rsquo;t been for Rapson. I think I
      ought to call &rsquo;em the <i>Rapsons</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you feel like that, why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t let me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Share the glory then. Call &rsquo;em <i>Spreckles</i> in public, and <i>Rapsons</i>
      among ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His simple old face lit up. &ldquo;Believe you&rsquo;ve solved it.&rdquo; We returned to our
      place by the shed, from which we could watch the haze of evening drifting
      across the billowy uplands. In the village at our feet, cattle were being
      driven home lowing to the milking. On the common boys were playing
      cricket; their laughter came to us softened by distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made you ask me?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask you? Ask you what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To come and visit you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But I&rsquo;m not popular at Pope Lane at present; I believe you
      know the reason. Grandmother Cardover must have told Aunt Lavinia that
      this was going to happen. That was why you sent that letter to the ship to
      meet me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked shy and awkward, and drew his hat down over his brows; I knew
      that he was making up his mind not to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was a boy,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;I always felt that I could come to you
      frankly. You, somehow, understood before anything had been said. I
      thought, perhaps, you might have understood this time, and that that was
      why you asked me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw his arm across my shoulder. &ldquo;I did, old chap. But you&rsquo;ve grown
      older and, since you&rsquo;ve got all this book-learning and all these grand
      friends, I kind o&rsquo; felt I was a stranger&mdash;thought you didn&rsquo;t need me
      like you used to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My grand friends and book-learning won&rsquo;t help me this turn,&rdquo; I grumbled
      slowly. &ldquo;I may need you pretty badly&mdash;perhaps, more than ever I did.
      You&rsquo;ve heard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umph!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d&rsquo;you think about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t much matter what an old knacker thinks about anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why on earth d&rsquo;you keep calling yourself an old knacker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunno. It&rsquo;s amusin&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a kind o&rsquo; luxury after spuffling all my life to
      be able at last to depreciate one&rsquo;s self. Everything&rsquo;s amusin&rsquo;. I know you
      are; I suppose I am; there&rsquo;s no doubt about your father. Nothing&rsquo;s
      overserious in this gay old world. Mustn&rsquo;t take things to heart, old chap.
      Look at me, what I&rsquo;ve come through. Here I am and not much the worse for
      wear&mdash;battered, but useful, yours truly Obadiah Spreckles, successful
      breeder of an entirely new strain of perpetually laying hens.&rdquo; He gave
      himself a resounding whack upon the chest and cocked his eye at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I think about you and the lady in America? Speaking as the
      ex-proprietor of a Christian Boarding House, I think it&rsquo;s shocking.
      Speaking as a man of leisure, I think it&rsquo;s confoundedly human. Speaking as
      a shipwrecked cabin-boy who&rsquo;s suddenly been promoted to captain, I should
      say that it&rsquo;s one of life&rsquo;s ups and downs. There&rsquo;s no accounting for how
      love takes a man; it&rsquo;s as fluky as settings of eggs&mdash;all cocks one
      day, all hens tomorrow, and the day after that nothing. Dash my boots, I
      sometimes think that nobody&rsquo;s to blame for anything. Love&rsquo;s shocking or
      interesting, according to your fancy. Take Lavinia and myself. I haven&rsquo;t
      made her a good husband. I&rsquo;ve been a failure and a slacker. I&rsquo;ve made her
      happy now only by an accident. People look at us and wonder what we find
      in one another. They don&rsquo;t know&mdash;can&rsquo;t see beneath the surface. We
      never had any children. It&rsquo;s been hard fighting. But I swear she&rsquo;s never
      regretted.&mdash;Aye, it&rsquo;s wonderful the pains God takes to bring a man
      and a woman together. These things ain&rsquo;t accidents. If you&rsquo;re meant to
      have her, you may have to wait, but nothing can stop you&mdash;just like
      me and my fowls. Life&rsquo;s a <i>leading</i>. &lsquo;He leadeth me beside the still
      waters,&rsquo; eh, what! But it&rsquo;s often rough treading till you get there.&mdash;That&rsquo;s
      all I have to say about it, old chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The door of Pope Lane&rsquo;s shut against me,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;Ruthie&rsquo;s married
      the fellow I detested. They&rsquo;re none of them talking to me now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old fellow turned on me snorting like a stallion. &ldquo;That don&rsquo;t matter,
      lad. You&rsquo;re your own world. Do without &rsquo;em. Everything comes right
      in the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dream Haven!</i> How cool the name sounds! What memories of sunshiny
      mornings it brings back. Day after day I watched and waited for the letter
      from America. There were times when I made sure that I could feel it
      approaching. &ldquo;It will be here to-morrow,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tortured myself by picturing how different life would have been had I
      taken Randall at his word. It was the kind of torture that became a
      luxury. I should have brought her to Dream Haven, perhaps. I played with
      my fancy, pretending that we were here together; so actual were my
      imaginings that I was incredulous when, on coming to myself, I found her
      absent. The dreams were more real than the reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wakened in the morning by the twittering of birds, I would raise myself on
      my elbow and marvel at the sweet flushed face beside me on the pillow and
      the glorious, yellow streaming hair. Slowly it would fade and vanish.
      There were walks which we took through the lonely woodlands when all the
      delayed intimacies of love filled life with unashamed passion. There were
      wild days on the downs, when rain and wind, driving our bodies together,
      stung me to a new protecting ecstasy. There were quiet evenings in the
      gloaming&mdash;Sunday evenings were the best&mdash;when Vi sat at the
      piano playing and singing, while Dorrie knelt beside her, fingering her
      dress. All these ghost-scenes stand clear in my memory as though they had
      happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must have cultivated this unreal life to the point of danger in my
      effort to escape the ache of the present. Had I lived by myself I might
      have crossed the border-line, but the comedy of Uncle Obad was always
      drawing me back. He kept watch over me like a kind old spaniel.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning from where I sat in the garden, I could see him farther
      down the slope through the orchard, trotting in and out his pens with his
      disreputable dust-coat flapping. Just as once, when he had no money, the
      appearance of affluence had been his hobby, so now, when he could afford
      to dress respectably, he delighted in looking shabby. He left his clothes
      unfastened in the most unexpected places; Aunt Lavinia was continually
      making grabs at him and buttoning him up. In the afternoon she sent us off
      for long walks together to prevent his getting fat. On these occasions he
      would explain his loose philosophy, which consisted of a large-minded,
      stalwart carelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your end up; it&rsquo;s in each one of us to be happy. Don&rsquo;t do too much
      remembering; live your day as it comes. Your Grandmother calls me the
      Spuffler&mdash;so I am. Where&rsquo;d I be now, I ask you, if I hadn&rsquo;t
      spuffled?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the summer fled by, and the woods grew browner, and the air had a
      sharper tang. The letter from Sheba had not come. I could mark time no
      longer; at last I left for Woadley.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III&mdash;NARCOTICS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> was twenty-six
      when I entered into possession of Woadley. By my grandfather&rsquo;s will I
      inherited an annual income of seven thousand pounds. I was at an age when,
      for most men, everything of importance lies in the future and that which
      lies behind is of no consequence&mdash;in the nature of an experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not regard my past in that light. It was vital. Until the woman I
      loved should share my fortunes I felt the future to be an indefinite
      postponement. How she could come into my life again I dared not surmise;
      that she would come, I never doubted. I knew now that the letter which I
      had both hoped for and dreaded, would never arrive. For Dorrie&rsquo;s sake they
      had decided to remain together. In my wiser moments I was glad of it; I
      knew that, had she chosen otherwise, our love would have been degraded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strong influences were brought to bear to press me into public life. My
      situation and training entitled me to take up a position of some local
      importance. I might have stood for Parliament, but I shrank from
      publicity. All I asked was to be left alone to follow up my own interests
      in quiet. I had come so suddenly into a sphere of power which I had done
      nothing to merit, that ambitions which had still other ambitions for their
      goal, ceased to allure me. My temperament was natively bookish; by nature
      I was a Fellow of Lazarus and by compulsion a conscientious country
      squire. When I was not at Oxford, dreaming in libraries, I was at Woadley,
      superintending the practical management of my estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The joy of sex and its fulfilment in a home, which apply the spur to most
      men&rsquo;s activities, to me were denied; it was unthinkable that I should
      marry any woman other than Vi. The energies which should have found a
      domestic expression with me became the mental stimulus of an absorbing
      scholarly pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through my Oxford lectures and fugitive contributions to periodicals, I
      began to be known as an authority on the intellectual revolt of the
      Renaissance; by slow degrees I set about writing the life of that strange
      contradiction, half-libertine, half-saint, Æneas Sylvius Piccolomini.
    </p>
    <p>
      Engaged in these employments, I grew to love the smooth gray days of
      Woadley which stole by ghost-like and unnumbered. And I came to love the
      Woadley country with a passion which was as much due to its associations
      as to its beauty. When I had grown tired of researches into things
      ancient, one of my greatest joys was to plod to Ransby through rutted
      lanes deep in hedges, and so out to the north beach where the sea strummed
      against the land, and the wind raged, and the blackened hull of the wreck
      crouched beneath the weight of sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandmother Cardover&rsquo;s shop saw me often. There in the keeping-room, with
      its dull red walls and leisurely loud ticking clock, we would talk
      together of bygone times and of those which were, maybe, coming. At first
      she urged me to marry, and to take up the position in the county which
      should be mine. But soon, with the easy fatalism of old age, she accepted
      me for what I was, and ceased to worry. .
    </p>
    <p>
      With my father I held no communication&mdash;the breach had become final;
      so of Ruthita I heard next to nothing. But as regards Lord Halloway, quite
      inadvertently I increased my knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      One squally night I was returning from Ransby, driving up the sodden road
      to the Hall, when my attention was attracted by a camp-fire. I halted out
      of curiosity, and struck across the turf to the light. Between me and the
      fire was a wind-break of young firs, a diminutive plantation behind which,
      as behind bars, figures prowled. As the flames shot up, the figures
      yearned toward the clouds; as the flames died down, the figures seemed to
      creep into the ground. On reaching the wind-break a lurcher growled, and I
      heard a man&rsquo;s voice telling the beast to lie quiet. I was about to declare
      myself, when a hand was laid on my shoulder. I leapt aside, peering into
      the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, brother,&rdquo; a voice said huskily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m meaning you no hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A woman&rsquo;s face pushed itself out of the blackness; by the light of the
      fire I saw that it was Lilith&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re here, brother, we&rsquo;ve come back to Woadley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke as though our meeting had been pre-arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gazing through the trees I saw the old yellow caravan: and G&rsquo;liath; the
      gaudy woman was there, and the hag who had tried to tell Vi&rsquo;s fortune on
      the marshes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The huddled gipsy tents became an accustomed sight and the center of a new
      interest in my landscape. The proud lawlessness of the gipsies appealed to
      my own suppressed wildness. They opened a door of escape from commonplace
      environment. Their unannounced comings and goings had an atmosphere of
      mystery and stealth which filled me with excitement. Of a night I would
      look out from my bedroom windows and see the red glow of their camp across
      the park-land; in the morning nothing would remain but blackened turf and
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went on many tramping expeditions with Lilith. She had become curiously
      elflike and wilful since those early days. She seemed to live wholly in
      the moods and sensations of the present; of the past she would speak only
      in snatches. Sometimes, when she softened, she would mention Ruthita; but
      it was long before I discovered her secret and the reason why for so many
      years the gipsies had refused to camp at Woadley.
    </p>
    <p>
      All one day in the height of summer we had wandered, across meadows and by
      unfrequented by-roads, too content to pay heed to where we were going;
      when evening overtook us we were miles from home. It was too late to turn
      back, unless we walked on to the nearest village and hired a trap and
      drove. Lilith scouted the proposal with scornful eyes as too utterly
      conventional. We would make a camp for the night and return to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, alone in the open, with great clouds thumbing the western sky, and
      birds sinking into tree-tops singing, &ldquo;Home, home, home,&rdquo; life liberated
      itself and rose in the throat as though it had never been bound and
      civilized. We spoke only in monosyllables; even words were a form of
      captivity. Collecting brushwood, we built our fire and ate our meal
      between the walls of bushes. Slowly the silver trumpet of the moon rose
      above leafy spires.
    </p>
    <p>
      We made a strange pair, Lilith and I&mdash;she the untamed savage,
      gloriously responsive, and I, for all my attitudes of mind, outwardly the
      sluggish product of reserve and education. Through the gray smoke I
      watched her, with her red shawl falling from her splendid shoulders, her
      glittering ear-rings and her large soft eyes. I told myself stories about
      her quite in the old childish vein. I recalled how the Bantam and I had
      always been hoping to find her. What fun it would be to vanish for a time,
      leaving responsibilities behind, and to take to the road together! White
      mists, rising from the meadows, erected a tent about us which towered to
      the sky. Here in the open was privacy from the impertinent knocking of
      destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was not thinking of me. Her eyes gazed far away. Her arm was
      hollowed and her head bowed, as though a little one pressed against her.
      With her right hand she fumbled at her breast, loosening her bodice. Her
      body swayed slowly to and fro in a soothing, rocking motion. I had seen
      her like this before when she thought no one was looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning forward I plucked a twig from the fire to light my pipe. She threw
      herself back from me startled and sprang to Her feet &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me.&rdquo; Her
      voice was hoarse and choking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking up from where I sat, I saw that her bosom panted and that her
      nostrils were quivering with animal fright. But it was her eyes that told
      me; they were wide and fixed like those of one who has been roused from
      sleep, and is not yet fully awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t trying to touch you, Lil. I&rsquo;m your pal, girl, Dante Cardover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I spoke she came to herself and recognized me. Her fear vanished and
      her arms fell limp to her side. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the trouble? I thought we were to camp here to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dun know.&rdquo; She swept back the hair from her forehead and drew her shawl
      tighter. &ldquo;I dun this before, just the two of us&mdash;and it didn&rsquo;t end
      happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afore ever I knew you, silly. When I was little more&rsquo;n a child&mdash;long
      time ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We stamped out the fire before we left, and stole silently across the
      moonlit meadows. She walked ahead at first in defiance; presently, ashamed
      of the distrust she had shown, she fell back and we traveled side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lil, I watched you; you were dreaming that you had your little baby
      back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She placed her hand in mine, but she gave me no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was he&mdash;the man who did this to you long ago, when you camped
      alone together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her face away; her voice shook with passion. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to
      tell you; you know &rsquo;im.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The people were few with whom we were both acquainted. I ran over the
      names in my mind; the truth flashed out on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it because of that you wouldn&rsquo;t camp at Woadley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bent her head, but the cloud of hatred in her face would have told me.
    </p>
    <p>
      After learning this new fact about Halloway, he was never long absent from
      my mind; for Lilith, though we never referred to him and she had at no
      time mentioned him by name, was a continual reminder. I became familiar
      with his doings through the papers. He was making a mark for himself in
      politics; there was even a talk that he might find a seat in the cabinet.
      I read of Lady Halloway&rsquo;s seconding of her husband&rsquo;s ambitions. From time
      to time her portrait was printed among those of society hostesses. But
      this Ruthita was unreal to me; she had nothing to do with the shy
      girl-friend whom I had known. Of the true Ruthita I learnt nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I often wondered what was the condition of affairs between herself and
      Halloway. Was she happy? Was he kind? Was it possible that she should have
      outlived her first judgment of him? Perhaps all this outward display of
      success had its hidden emptiness. Behind Halloway lay a host of ruined
      lives, Lilith&rsquo;s among them, the waste of which he could not justify.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been five years at Woadley, when my work made it necessary that I
      should spend some weeks in London in order to be near libraries. It was
      just after Christmas that I came to town. With my usual clinging to old
      associations, I took rooms at Chelsea, almost within sight of the mansion
      which had witnessed my uncle&rsquo;s brief reign of splendor. From my windows I
      could see the turgid river sweeping down to Westminster, and the
      nurse-girls with perambulators and scarlet dots of soldiers loitering
      beneath bare trees of the Embankment.
    </p>
    <p>
      On rising one morning, I found that the subdued grays and browns had
      vanished&mdash;that London was glistening with snow. My spirits rose to an
      unaccustomed pitch of buoyancy; I tossed aside my writing and went out
      into the streets. Coming to the Spuffer&rsquo;s old house I halted; the memory
      of the Christmas I had spent there leapt into my mind with every detail
      sharpened. Things which I had not thought of for years came back
      luminously&mdash;scraps of conversation, gestures, childish excitements.
      This wintry morning was reminiscent of a snow-lit, sun-dazzled morning of
      long ago. I recalled how Ruthita had bounced into my room to let me see
      her presents; how she had balanced herself on the edge of my bed in her
      long white night-gown, with her legs curled under her and her small feet
      showing; how she had laughed at my care of her when I wrapped the
      counterpane about her shoulders to prevent her from catching cold. Every
      memory was somehow connected with Ruthita. And here I stood, a man of
      thirty, looking up at the windows from which we had once gazed out
      together&mdash;and I had not seen her to speak to for five years.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not get her out of mind. I did not want to. I kept tracing
      resemblances to her in the girls whom I passed in the streets. Some of
      them were carrying their skates, with flying hair and flushed faces.
      Others, whom I met after lunch in the theatre districts, were going to
      matinées with school-boy brothers. I wanted to be back again in the old
      intimacy, walking beside her. Since that was impossible, I set myself
      deliberately to remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon I strolled into the Green Park. Constitution Hill was
      scattered with spectators all agape to see the quality drive by. Every now
      and then a soldier or statesman would be recognized; the word would pass
      from mouth to mouth with a flutter of excitement. The trees enameled in
      white, the grass in its sparkling blanket, the sky banked with soft
      clouds, the flushed faces&mdash;everything added its hint of animated and
      companionable kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of a sudden in the throng of flashing carriages, my attention was caught
      by an intense white face approaching, half-hidden in a mass of night-black
      hair&mdash;the face was smaller than ever, and even more pathetically
      patient. By her side sat the man whom I now almost hated, looking handsome
      and important; the years had dealt well with him, and had heightened his
      air of dignity and aristocratic assurance. He was speaking to her lazily
      while she paid him listless attention, never meeting his glance. It was
      plain to see that, whatever he had or had not been to other women, his
      passion for her was unabated. She looked a snow-drop set beside an exotic
      orchid; the demure simplicity of her beauty was accentuated by the
      contrast. Her wandering gaze fell in my direction; for an instant my gaze
      absorbed her. She started forward from the cushions; her features became
      nipped with eagerness. Those wonderful eyes of hers, which had always had
      power to move me, seemed to speak of years of longing. A smile parted her
      lips; her listlessness was gone. She leant out of the carriage, as though
      she would call to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Halloway&rsquo;s hand had gone to his hat, as he turned with a gracious
      expression, searching the crowd to discover the cause of his wife&rsquo;s
      excitement. His eyes met mine. His face hardened. Seizing Ruthita&rsquo;s arm,
      he dragged her down beside him. The carriage swept by and was lost in the
      stream of passing traffic. All was over in less time than it has taken to
      narrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night at Chelsea I could not sleep for thinking. Across the ceiling I
      watched the lights of the police-boats flash in passing. I listened to the
      river grumbling between its granite walls. Late taxis purred by; I took to
      counting them. Big Ben lifted up his solemn voice, speaking to the stars
      of change and time. I thought, imagined, remembered. What had happened to
      us all that we were so gravely altered? What had happened to her? What had
      he done to quench her? Then came the old, forgotten question: had I had
      anything to do with it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day I set myself to conquer my restlessness, but my accustomed
      interests had lost their fascination. Neither that day, nor in those that
      followed, could I recover my grip on my habitual methods of life. What
      were the temptations, disappointments of a dead past compared with those
      that were now in the acting? My scholarship, my love of books, my
      undertakings at Woadley had only been in the nature of narcotics; I had
      drugged myself into partial forgetfulness. Now the old affections, like
      old wounds, ached and irked me. One glimpse of Ruthita&rsquo;s white intensity
      had stabbed me into keenest remembrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I <i>had</i> to see her again; the hunger to hear her speak was on me&mdash;to
      listen to the sound of her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several times I saw her driving in the Park, sometimes alone, sometimes
      with Halloway. She never looked at me, but I was certain she was aware of
      me by the way her cheek grew pale. Only a few years ago I had been half
      her life, free to hold her, to come and go with her, to disregard her; now
      she passed me unnoticed. I haunted all places where I might expect to find
      her; whether I met or missed her my pain was the same. At the back of my
      mind was the constant dread that her husband would hurry her away to where
      I could not follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a blustering afternoon in early March, on a day of laughing and
      crying&mdash;one of those raw spring days, before spring really commences,
      capricious as a young girl nearing womanhood, without reason gay and
      without reason serious. In the sunshine one could believe that it was
      almost summer, but winter lurked in the shadows. A flush of young green
      spread through the tree-tops; in open spaces crocuses shivered near
      together. The streets were boisterous with gusty puffs of wind which sent
      dust and papers circling. In stiff ranks, like soldiers, the houses stood,
      erect, straining their heads into the sky, as if trying to appear taller.
      Clouds hurried and fumed along overhead travel-routes, and rent gashes in
      their sides as if with knives, letting through the sudden turquoise.
      Presently slow drops began to patter. Umbrellas shot up. Bus-drivers
      unstrapped their capes. In the Circus flower-girls picked up their baskets
      and ran for shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving in the Mall I found people standing along the open pavement in
      a lean, straggling line, despite the threatened deluge, I learnt that
      royalty were expected. Soon I heard a faint and far-off cheering. A
      policeman raised his arm; traffic drew up beside the curb. Just as I had
      caught the flash of Life Guards and the clatter of their accoutrements, a
      closed brougham reined in across my line of vision. With an exclamation of
      annoyance I was moving farther down the pavement, when a small gloved hand
      stretched out from the carriage-window and touched me. I turned sharply,
      and found myself gazing into Ruthita&rsquo;s eyes. She signed to me to open the
      door. Before the coachman could notice who had entered, I was beside her.
      Clutching my arm, she leant out and ordered, &ldquo;Drive to Pope Lane.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IV&mdash;RUTHITA
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e lay back against
      the cushions. We acted like conspirators&mdash;it was difficult to tell
      why. The surprise of meeting her thus suddenly had deprived me of words.
      It must have been the same with her; we clasped hands in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to see you&mdash;had to speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was panting&mdash;almost crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Why not? It was foolish to go on the way we were going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, foolish and heartbreaking. It wasn&rsquo;t as though we were wanting to do
      anything wicked&mdash;only to meet one another, as we used to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice trailed off into a little shivering sob; she flickered her
      eye-lids to prevent the tears from gathering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruthie, you mustn&rsquo;t carry on so.&rdquo; Then, &ldquo;What has he done to you?&rdquo; I
      asked fiercely. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s guessed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guessed what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you never knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you. If you&rsquo;d guessed, it might have made all the
      difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not dare to speak&mdash;her whisper was so ashamed. Her hand was hot
      in mine. She withdrew it. When I leant over her she shuddered, just as the
      trees had done when they knew the rain was coming, as though I were a
      thing to her both sweet and dreadful. She took my face between her hands,
      and yet shrank back from me. She delighted in and feared the thing she was
      doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain volleyed against the carriage, shutting us in as with a tightly
      drawn curtain; yet, did I look up, through the gray mist the tepid gold of
      the sun was shining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruthie, it seems almost too good to be true that we&rsquo;re alone at last
      together&mdash;to have you all to myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever want me, Dannie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Did I ever want you!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as much as you wanted her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Differently, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You poor boy. And you didn&rsquo;t get either of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be helped, Ruthie. That&rsquo;s life&mdash;to be always wanting and
      never getting. But I have you now and, perhaps, one day&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can you? She&rsquo;s married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can&rsquo;t tell. Things come unexpectedly. I didn&rsquo;t expect half-an-hour
      ago that I&rsquo;d be with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She fell to asking me little stabbing questions. When I only answered her
      vaguely, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s start with secrets,&rdquo; she implored me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s five years&mdash;there&rsquo;s so much to explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;on both sides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seemed&mdash;seemed to dislike him,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I never understood&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took me up quickly. &ldquo;Nor did I. Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk about it&mdash;not
      yet, Dante.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I told her about my doings, the book I was writing and the little daily
      round at Woadley; and then I told her of why I had quarreled with my
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he let me marry Halloway, and you&rsquo;ve never&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I laughed.
      &ldquo;Ah, but no matter what Halloway did as a bachelor, he was discreet when
      it came to marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew me forward to the light; doubt was in her eyes. &ldquo;But you&mdash;you&rsquo;re
      unhappy too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gained everything I played for; I played to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t deserve Vi. And I didn&rsquo;t deserve you; if I had, I shouldn&rsquo;t have
      lost you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not until I had replied did she realize how much she had told me. She was
      not happy! I wanted to ask her questions, so many questions&mdash;questions
      which I had no right to ask, nor she to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&mdash;you have no children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rubbed the damp from the panes. We were in Stoke Newington. The storm
      was over; streets and roof-tops shone as with liquid fire. Children going
      home from school, were laughing and playing. They might have been myself
      and Ruthie of years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t see me,&rdquo; I warned her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Folks at Pope Lane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not there. Only Hetty&rsquo;s left to take care of the house. They&rsquo;ve
      gone away for a few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I can see it all again. We can walk in the garden together and
      pretend that things are exactly as they were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dannie!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I <i>can</i> call you Dannie, can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Time slipped away. She was my little sister now&mdash;no longer Lady
      Halloway. At the posts before the passage we alighted&mdash;that was the
      first news the coachman had of whom he had been driving. We went slowly up
      the lane, where the shadows of the limes groped like tentacles fingering
      the sunshine. When I felt beneath the creepers and the bell jangled
      faintly, Ruthita clutched my arm, attempting to appear bold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetty stared at us. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be blowed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We pushed by her smiling, assuring her that we had no objection. Not until
      we had rounded the house, did I hear the rattle of the door closing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing ever changed in that walled-in garden. Flowers grew in the same
      places&mdash;crocuses, daffodils, and hyacinths. Peaches on the wall would
      soon ripen. Presently sunflowers, like sentinels in gold helmets, would
      stand in stately line. Pigeons strutted on the slates of houses opposite
      or wheeled against the sky. There was the window of Ruthita&rsquo;s bedroom, up
      to which I had so often called.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hole, which had been bricked up between the Favarts&rsquo; garden, was still
      discernible. Everything retained its record; only we had changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truants again, stealing an hour together, I listened expectant to hear
      Hetty call, &ldquo;Dant-ee. Dant-ee. Bedtime.&rdquo; The old excitement clutched my
      heart. Her starched skirt would rustle down the path, and we would run
      into the gooseberry bushes to hide. I glanced at the study-window. Surely
      I should see my father seated there, leaning across the desk with his head
      propped by his arm. Surely that hand of Ruthita&rsquo;s in my own was growing
      smaller. I should turn to find a child in a short print-frock, with
      clusters of ringlets on her shoulders. A shutter in my mind had opened;
      the past had become present. Ah, but I was no longer anxious to escape.
      The walled-in garden was all I wanted. I was tired of liberty. I was ready
      to be commanded. I was willing that others should order my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the illusion might not slip from me, I half shut my eyes. Drip, drip,
      drip, from eaves and branches! The earth was stirring in the gentle quiet.
      Through drenched bushes and on the vivid stretch of lawn blackbirds were
      hopping, delving with their yellow bills. Perhaps I was dwindling into a
      small boy, just as I had once hoped in the forest that I might suddenly
      shoot up into manhood. How absurd to believe that I was thirty, and had
      seen so much of disillusionment! That was all a dream out of which I was
      waking&mdash;I had been here all the time in the narrow confines of the
      walled-in garden. The old enchantment of familiar sensations stole upon me&mdash;I
      was Dannie Cardover of the Red House; playing tricks with his imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      How did it happen? Was it I or was it Ruthie? Her lips were pressing mine.
      A step came down the path behind us. We sprang apart, laughing softly with
      reckless joy at our impropriety. Which of us would have thought ten years
      ago that there would be anything improper in being caught kissing?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetty pretended not to have seen us, but her flustered face told its
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;you remember, Hetty, how I once found you doing that to John?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She writhed her hands under her apron, trying to appear shocked and not to
      smile. &ldquo;I remember, Sir Dante; &lsquo;t&rsquo;aint likely I&rsquo;d forget.&rdquo; Then,
      disregarding me for Ruthita, &ldquo;I was about to h&rsquo;arsk your ladyship, whether
      I should get tea ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruthita took her by the hand. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t talk to me that way once, Hetty.
      I&rsquo;m just Ruthie to you always, and Sir Dante is plain Dannie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up and met the laughing reproach in our eyes. Her apron went to
      her face and her bodice commenced to quiver. &ldquo;Little did I think when I
      washed and dressed yer little bodies that I should ever see this day,&rdquo; she
      sobbed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s breakin&rsquo; me &lsquo;eart, that&rsquo;s what it is, all this quarrelin&rsquo;.
      Why shouldn&rsquo;t I speak to &rsquo;im if I wants ter? Why shouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;e
      kiss &rsquo;is own sister if he likes? Wot&rsquo;s it matter if all the
      neighbors was lookin&rsquo;? There&rsquo;s too little lovin&rsquo; and too little kissin&rsquo;;
      that&rsquo;s wot I say. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t right ter be ashamed o&rsquo; bein&rsquo; nateral. If it
      &lsquo;adn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; been for bein&rsquo; afraid and ashamed, I might &rsquo;a&rsquo;
      married John. The nus-girl next door got &rsquo;im. There&rsquo;s allaws been
      someone a-lookin&rsquo; when I was courtin&rsquo;&mdash;there&rsquo;s been, too little
      kissin&rsquo; in my life, and it&rsquo;s yer Pa&rsquo;s fault, if I do say it, wi&rsquo; &rsquo;is
      everlastin&rsquo; look of &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t yer do it.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s as bad as all that, Hetty, I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t mind if I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       She made an emotional armful, but between struggling and giggling she
      allowed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had tea together in the formal dining-room, with its heavy furniture
      and snug red walls. We made Hetty sit beside us; she protested and was
      scandalized, but we wouldn&rsquo;t let her wait. As we talked, the old freedom
      of happiness came back to Ruthita&rsquo;s laughter. The mask of enforced
      prejudices lifted from Hetty&rsquo;s face. All our conversation was of the past&mdash;our
      adventures, childish mutinies, and punishments. We told Hetty what a
      tyrant she had been to us. We asked her whether her nightgowns were still
      of gray flannel. I accused her of being the start of all my naughtiness in
      the explanation she had given me of how marriages were concocted. It was
      like putting a wilted flower into water to see the way she picked up and
      freshened. When she had nothing else to reply, she wagged her head at us,
      exclaiming, &ldquo;Oh, my h&rsquo;eye&mdash;what goin&rsquo;s on! It&rsquo;s a good thing walls
      ain&rsquo;t got ears. What would your poor Pa say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We left her and wandered through the rooms together. We only opened the
      study-door; we did not enter. It had always, even when we had been
      invited, seemed to have been closed against us. Books lay on the desk,
      dust-covered. It was allowed to be tidied only in my father&rsquo;s presence. We
      both felt that he must know of our trespassing, even though we could not
      see him. I had the uncanny feeling that he was still there at the table
      writing; any moment he might glance up, having completed his sentence, and
      I should hear his voice. Not until we had climbed the stairs did we rid
      ourselves of the shadow of his disapproval. In the old days when we were
      romping, we had been accustomed to hear his dreaded door open and his
      stern voice calling, &ldquo;Children! Children! What d&rsquo;you think you&rsquo;re doing?
      Not so much noise.&rdquo; It was something of this kind we were now expecting
      and with the same sensations of trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was memory-haunted. Following our footsteps, yet so discreetly
      that we never caught them, were a witch-faced girl and a sturdy boy. Where
      pools of sunlight lay upon the floor we lost them; when we turned into
      dark passages, again they followed. On entering rooms, we half expected to
      find them occupied with their playing; when the budding creeper stirred
      against the walls, it was as though they whispered. They were always
      somewhere where we were not&mdash;either in the room we had just left, or
      the room to which we were going.
    </p>
    <p>
      We entered what had been my bedroom. The sun was westering, playing
      hide-and-seek behind crooked chimneypots. Below us the garden lay in
      shadow, cool and cloistered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kneeling beside the window, with our elbows on the sill, not watching one
      another&rsquo;s eyes, we whispered by fits and starts, leaving our sentences
      unended. Most of what we said commenced with &ldquo;Do you remember?&rdquo; and
      drifted off into silence as the picture formed. It was like flinging
      pebbles into a pond and watching the circles spreading. One after another
      memories came and departed&mdash;all that we had done together and been to
      one another in that conspiracy of childhood. There was the pink muffler
      she had made me, the guinea-pig about which I had lied to her, the tragic
      departures and wild homecomings of schooldays, and the week when the
      Bantam had declared his love for her. And there were memories which
      preceded her knowledge&mdash;my quest for the magic carpet. How I wished I
      might yet find it; I would fly by night to her window and carry her off,
      re-visiting old happinesses while Lord Halloway lay snoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t know how we came to it&mdash;I suppose we must have been speaking
      about Vi. Presently Ruthita said, &ldquo;You could only love golden hair, could
      you, Dannie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t know what she was driving at; her voice shook and her face was
      flushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dark-haired girls never had any chance with you, did they? You told me
      that long ago, after Fiesole. I remembered because&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was a boy then, and was clumsy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you spoke the truth, though you did say that for sisters black hair
      was the prettiest in the world. It hurt because at that time I fancied&mdash;you
      can guess what.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never showed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never looked for it&mdash;never asked for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew to what she referred. It was on the night of my sudden return from
      the Red House because the Spuffler had lost our money. I was sitting at
      this window as I was now sitting. A tap at the door had startled me; then
      a timid voice had said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only Ruthita.&rdquo; She had crept in noiselessly
      as a shadow. Her dear arms went about my neck, drawing down my face. &ldquo;Oh,
      Dannie, I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; she had whispered; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never missed welcoming you
      home ever since you went to school.&rdquo; She had nestled against me in the
      dark, her face looking frailer and purer than ever. She had slipped on a
      long blue dressing-gown, I remember, and her black hair hung about her
      shoulders like a cloud. Just below the edge of the gown her pale feet
      twinkled. I noticed that a physical change had come over her. Then I had
      realized for the first time that she was different as I was different&mdash;we
      were no longer children. I had fallen to wondering whether the same
      wistful imaginings, exquisite and alluring, had come to her. With an
      overwhelming reverence, I had become aware of the strange fascination of
      her appealing beauty. In the confessing that followed I had told her of my
      jilting by Fiesole, and had spoken those stupid words about loving only
      golden hair. How wounding I had been in my boyish egotism! And that was
      not the last time I had wounded her in my blindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scene after scene came back to me&mdash;into each I read a new meaning in
      the light of what she had told me: the Snow Lady&rsquo;s hints before I sailed
      for America; Ruthita&rsquo;s appeal for my protection against Halloway, and her
      sudden acceptance of him directly she heard that I was with Vi at Sheba.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruthie, all this was very long ago; so many things have happened since
      then, there can be no harm in talking about it. You wanted me right up to
      the last&mdash;and I was too selfish to know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right up to the last,&rdquo; she whispered, and I knew she meant right up to
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this&mdash;and this is what your husband has guessed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took my hands in both her own, speaking with quiet dignity. &ldquo;I had to
      tell you. Perhaps I too have been selfish, but I couldn&rsquo;t let you
      misunderstand me any longer. I&rsquo;ve seen you watching for me, and I&rsquo;ve had
      to go by you without looking. We never had any secrets, you and I; you
      must have wondered why I let my husband make me cut you&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been
      wicked&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t trust myself. When I heard that you&rsquo;d gone to
      Sheba, I didn&rsquo;t care what happened. I&rsquo;d always hoped and hoped that you
      might come to love me. But it seemed I wasn&rsquo;t wanted, so I just took&mdash;&mdash;
      He&rsquo;s been good to me, but it isn&rsquo;t like living with the person you love
      best, is it? You mustn&rsquo;t hate him any more; to love a woman who can&rsquo;t love
      you back again makes even success empty&mdash;and he&rsquo;s been used to take
      love without asking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We sat very still. We saw Hetty come out into the garden and walk down the
      path as though she were looking for us. We waited to hear her call, but
      she re-entered the house, leaving the silence unruffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made a pretty fair mess of things, haven&rsquo;t I? There was Vi first,
      and now there&rsquo;s you. I&rsquo;m a pretty fair blighter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pressed herself against me to stop me. &ldquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t say that. It
      hurts. You mustn&rsquo;t say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am. Even your husband knows it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day you&rsquo;ll marry and everything&rsquo;ll come right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Vi, if we have the luck to come together. But what about you? What
      about even Halloway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She avoided answering my self-accusations by attracting attention to
      herself. &ldquo;From the first he didn&rsquo;t want me to know you; he gave excuses,
      and I understood. Because I couldn&rsquo;t give him love, I gave him everything
      else that he wanted. But now&mdash;now that I&rsquo;m going to be a mother, I
      had to tell you. I want it to be a boy, Dannie. Waiting for him, I&rsquo;ve
      thought so much of old days. I felt that if you didn&rsquo;t know, somehow,
      things wouldn&rsquo;t go right&mdash;because when he comes I want him to be like
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had risen, letting go my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had always thought of you as my sister,&rdquo; I faltered. &ldquo;I know&mdash;and
      you were a dear brother. It was just my foolishness to want you to be
      something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she clung to me, hiding her face against my shoulder. Then we
      passed down the stairs, afraid to be alone any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goin&rsquo;?&rdquo; Hetty inquired. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t tell the master, will yer?&rdquo; She
      glanced toward the study-door as though he were behind it and might have
      overheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the lane the carriage was standing. In the presence of the
      coachman Ruthita&rsquo;s tones were conventional. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going westwards? Where
      can I drop you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the carriage I asked her whether her husband would know of what we had
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think he might be willing to let us be friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask him,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At Hyde Park Corner the carriage pulled up and I alighted. I watched her
      eager face looking back at me, growing smaller and smaller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wandering aimlessly through the parks, I sat for a time by the Serpentine.
      The nerves of all that had happened in the past five years were cut. If I
      had married Ruthita, would she have been happy? The thought of marrying
      her was just as impossible to me now as it had been when Grandmother
      Cardover had mentioned it at Ransby. And yet, at a time when I had been
      most sensitive of injustice, I had been unjust to her&mdash;&mdash; And
      now she was going to be a mother&mdash;little Ruthita, who seemed to me
      herself so much a child!
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came into Whitehall, the pale twilight of spring still hovered
      above house-tops; from streets the flare of London steamed up. The opal of
      the sky reflected the marigold-yellow of illumined windows; arc-lights,
      like ox-eye daisies, stared above the grass of the dusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made my way to my club and sank into a chair, aimlessly skimming the
      papers, reading scarcely a line. Few people were about; the room was empty
      save for one other loiterer. Spring in the streets was calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man strolled up to me, holding an illustrated weekly in his hand. I
      knew him slightly and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Writing a book on the Renaissance, ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you? Here&rsquo;s something a bit in
      your line. Funny how Paris&rsquo;ll go mad over a thing like that!&rdquo; He smacked
      the page. &ldquo;Girl comes from nowhere. Her lover writes a play&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      the story. There&rsquo;s a mystery. The play&rsquo;s difficult to understand, so it
      must be brainy. Now I like a thing that don&rsquo;t need no explanation: Marie
      Lloyd, the Empire, musical comedy&mdash;that&rsquo;s my cut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tossed me the weekly and turned on his heel to walk out. Annoyed at
      being disturbed, I glanced down irritably.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a full-page illustration the face of Fiesole smiled up.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was ridiculous
      this curiosity, but I knew how to explain it&mdash;it grew out of my
      life&rsquo;s great emptiness since I had listened to Ruthita&rsquo;s confession. She
      had made me realize as never before how I had muddled my chances of
      happiness. I had heard nothing from Vi in all these years and now I had
      learnt that, without knowing it, I might have had Ruthita. My interests
      had lost their charm; I wanted an excuse to leave my work. This matter of
      Fiesole had cropped up, so here I was on my way to Paris, more for the
      sake of something to do than anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not the remotest intention of renewing her acquaintance. Unseen by
      her, I would watch her from some corner of the theatre, and then slip back
      to London. There would be piquancy in the thought that I had gone to see
      her for old time&rsquo;s sake, and that she would never know about it. As for
      speaking to her, that would be an insult after what had happened at
      Venice. Probably she hated me. She ought to, if she did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though I smiled at myself, truth to tell, I was rather pleased to find I
      could still be so impulsive; romance in me was not dead after all these
      years of uneventful waiting. This journey was the folly of a sentimental
      boy&mdash;not the cynical act of a man of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>La Fiesole! La Fiesole!</i> Since she had stared out at me from the
      printed page I was continually coming across her. Everyone was discussing
      her; she had sprung out of nowhere into notoriety. Greater than Bernhardt,
      men said of her: a spontaneous emotional actress of the first rank&mdash;the
      sensation of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      France took her seriously; England quoted French eulogies in italics.
      Fantastic legends were woven about her name, made plausible by an
      occasional touch of accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antoine Georges had written the play&mdash;it was based on the <i>amours</i>
      of Lucrezia Borgia. It was said that he was La Fiesole&rsquo;s lover, that she
      had given him the plot&mdash;that she had even helped him write it; some
      went so far as to say that it was founded on an incident in her own past
      life, transposed into a fifteenth century setting. Antoine Georges denied
      that he was her lover; but the world smiled skeptically&mdash;it liked to
      believe he was. One story asserted that she had been a <i>fille de joie</i>
      when he came across her; another, with that French instinct for the
      theatric, that he had reclaimed her from a low café in Cherbourg in which
      she danced. Nothing was too incredible in the face of her incredible
      success. One fact alone was undisputed&mdash;that she was the daughter of
      the famous Italian actor, many years dead, Signore Cortona.
    </p>
    <p>
      This confirmed what I already knew about her. I remembered how she had
      told me in Oxford of her early stage career, which she had abandoned to go
      traveling. I recalled how she had said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an amateur at living&mdash;always
      chopping and changing. I&rsquo;ll find what I want some day.&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash; So
      she had found it!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the English press she was made a peg on which to hang a whole wardrobe
      of side-issue and prejudice. The decency of the French stage was
      discussed. The question was introduced as to whether such a play would be
      allowed to be performed in London. The superiority of English morals was
      the topic of some articles; of others, the brutal prudery by which British
      art was stifled. A fine opportunity was afforded and welcomed for slinging
      mud at the censor. The discussion was given academic sanction when Andrew
      Lang patted it on the head in an ingeniously discursive monologue on the
      anachronisms of playwrights, in which he made clear that Monsieur
      Georges&rsquo;s tragedy was riddled with historic falsity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearing five when we steamed into the Gare du Nord. My first
      journey to Paris had been prompted by Fiesole. Then I was escaping from
      her; now I was going to her. For old time&rsquo;s sake I made my headquarters at
      the hotel at which I had then stayed in the Rue St. Honoré. After <i>diner</i>
      I set out through thronged streets to book a seat at the theatre. Upon
      making my request at the office, the man shrugged his shoulders and turned
      away with the inimitable insolence of French manners. It was as though he
      had said, &ldquo;You must be mad, or extremely bourgeois.&rdquo; I had affronted him
      personally, the theatre-management, La Fiesole and last, but not least,
      the infallible intelligence of Paris. Did Monsieur not know that La
      Fiesole was the rage, the fashion? Every seat was taken&mdash;taken weeks
      ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      My second request was apologetic and explanatory: I honored La Fiesole so
      much that I had journeyed from London on purpose to see her. What was the
      earliest date at which he could make it possible? He directed me to an
      agency which had bought up all the best seats in the house; here I secured
      a box at an extortionate price for five nights later.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the intervening days I was frequently tempted to abandon my project and
      return. It seemed the height of foolishness to squander five days in order
      that I might court disappointment. She must have altered&mdash;might have
      deteriorated. It was just possible there was a grain of truth in the wild
      stories that circulated about her. And yet&mdash;&mdash; There were
      memories that came to me full of nobility and gentleness: windswept days
      at Oxford; a night at Ferrara; days and nights on the lapping lagoons of
      Venice. I wanted to see her again&mdash;and I did not. I blew hot and
      cold. And while I hesitated, spring raced through the streets of Paris
      with tossing arms and reckless laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I entered the theatre it was already packed. The audience seemed
      conscious that it had assembled for a great occasion; it had dressed for
      its share in the undertaking. Gowns of marvelous cut and audacity were in
      evidence. The atmosphere was heavy with the perfume of exotic femininity
      and flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      My box was on the right-hand side, just above and next to the stage. Below
      me was a nodding sea of plumed head-dresses, naked shoulders, and gleaming
      bosoms; rising tier on tier to the gold-domed roof, was a wall of eyes and
      fluttering white faces. Everything was provocative of expectancy. Gods and
      goddesses, carved on the columns and painted on the curtain, alone were
      immobile.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quick succession of taps sounded, followed by three long raps. The
      theatre was plunged in shadow. As though a crowd drew away into the
      distance, the last murmur spent itself. The curtain quivered, then rose
      reluctantly on the illusion which had brought the unrelated lives of so
      vast an audience together.
    </p>
    <p>
      We saw an Italian garden, basking in sunlight and languorous with summer.
      Beneath the black shade of cypress-trees stretched marble terraces,
      mounting up a hillside, up and up, till they hung gleaming like white
      birds halfhidden in the velvet foliage. In the foreground a fountain
      splashed. A little way distant the Pope Alexander lolled, toying with his
      mistress, Giulia. Up and down pathways lined with statues, groups of
      courtiers wandered: youths in parti-colored hose and slashed doublets;
      girls, vividly attired, exquisitely young, engaged in the game of love.
      Guitars tinkled and masses of bloom flared stridently in the sun. Sitting
      by the fountain was the Madonna Lu-crezia and the young Lord of Pesaro.
      Her face was turned from us; we could only see her vase-like figure and
      the way she shook her head in answer to all he offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The envoy from Naples enters and with him the Duke of Biseglia; he urges
      the Pope for a last time to make an alliance with his country by
      betrothing the Madonna Lucrezia to the Duke. But the Pope does not want
      the alliance; he is joining with Ludovico of Milan against Naples and war
      will result.&rsquo; While the Pope is refusing, for the first time Lucrezia
      looks up and her face is turned towards us&mdash;the face I had known in
      my boyhood, innocently girlish, fresh as a flower, so ardent and beautiful
      with longing that the theatre caught its breath at sight of it and a
      muffled &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; swept through the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      As though attracted by a power which is outside herself, she rises,
      hesitating between shyness and daring, and steals to where the young Duke
      is sullenly standing. She takes his hand and presses it against her
      breast. He snatches it from her. She commences to speak, at first
      haltingly, but with gathering passion. Her voice is hoarse and sultry,
      like that of a Jewess; it is a voice shaken with emotion, which now
      caresses and now tears at the heart. The drone of merriment in the garden
      and the tinkling of the guitars is hushed. Listless lovers come out from
      the shadows and gather about her, amused by her earnestness. She pleads
      with the Pope, her father, to give her the Duke&mdash;not to send him away
      from her. Biseglia interrupts haughtily, asserting that he only desired
      her for State reasons and that since the Pope refuses Naples&rsquo; friendship,
      he would not marry the Madonna Lucrezia though her father were to allow
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander laughs boisterously at this quarrel of children and like a huge
      Silenus wanders off into the garden, leaning on his mistress, Giulia,
      followed by his train of minstrels and dilettantes. Their singing grows
      more faint as they mount the terraces towards the palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucrezia watches them depart with a face frozen with despair. As Biseglia
      turns to go, she darts after him and drags him back, fawning on him,
      abasing herself, offering herself to him, telling him that whatever comes
      of it she cannot live without him. He regards her in silence; then falls
      to smiling and flings her from him, reminding her that she is the Pope&rsquo;s
      bastard. At that the boy Lord of Pesaro, who has watched everything from
      the fountain, runs with drawn sword to her defense. But she springs
      between them, saying that when the time comes to kill Biseglia, she will
      take revenge in her own way like a Borgia. The great Pope, looking back,
      has seen her awakened savagery and laughs uproariously. The scene ends
      with the garden empty and Lucrezia stretched out on the ground, kissing
      the spot which Biseglia&rsquo;s feet have touched and weeping in a frenzy of
      abandon, while the Lord of Pesaro looks on impotent and broken-hearted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the first act and the second the French have invaded Italy, so the
      Pope and the King of Naples have found a common enemy and a common need
      for alliance. The Duke of Biseglia has again been sent to Rome to sue for
      the hand of Lucrezia. But in the meanwhile she has been betrothed to the
      Lord of Pesaro, and, to prevent him from joining with the French when
      Lucrezia is taken from him, his removal has been planned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtain goes up on a night of bacchanalian riot in the Papal gardens.
      Beneath trees a costly table has been spread, at which sit men and women
      attired in every kind of extravagance, as animals, pagan deities, and
      mythological monstrosities. In the branches overhead are set sconces and
      blazing torches. Distantly over white terraces and pathways the moon is
      rising. In the foreground are mummers and tumblers. The servitors who pass
      up and down the company are humpbacks, dwarfs, Ethiopians, and
      dancing-girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the center of the table sits the Pope, and next to him Lucrezia, and
      next to her Biseglia. Opposite to Biseglia is seated the Lord of Pesaro,
      and next to him a woman in a mask. With the heat of the wine and the
      lateness of the hour the women lie back in their lovers&rsquo; arms&mdash;all
      except the masked woman and the Madonna Lucrezia. Lucrezia sits erect like
      a frightened child, the one pure thing in the freedom that surrounds her.
      Biseglia pays her no attention, and from across the table the Lord of
      Pesaro watches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pope twits Biseglia on his coldness, saying, &ldquo;Think you that my
      daughter hath a deformity?&rdquo; And Biseglia gives the irritable answer, &ldquo;Can
      a man love a woman while that young spit-fire glowers green envy at him
      opposite?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pesaro leaps to his feet, but the Pope, as though to pacify him, pledges
      him and hands the goblet to the masked woman to offer to him. Still
      standing uncertain, Pesaro receives it from her. Raising it slowly, his
      lips touch the brim; he clutches at his throat, upsetting the cup so that
      the red stain flows towards Lucrezia. He leans out, gazes in her eyes, and
      crashes across the table, twisting as he falls, still looking up at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence that follows is broken by a low rippling laugh. The company
      gaze in astonishment; it is Lucrezia who is laughing. The child in her
      face is dead; her expression is inscrutable, wicked and sirenish. She
      sways towards Biseglia, bending back her head and twining her arms about
      him. &ldquo;Hath the Pope&rsquo;s daughter a deformity that thou canst not love her?
      Behold, thou shalt judge. She will dance and dance, till she dances thee
      into rapture and thy soul is poured out upon her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the hand of a servitor she snatches a torch and steps into the open.
      She commences to dance and, as she dances, unbuckles her girdle so that
      her gown slips from her. As the beat of the music grows more furious she
      unbinds her hair, so that it writhes like snakes about her firm white arms
      and bust. Dwarfs clamber into trees and slide out along their branches,
      raining rose-leaves on her as she passes. The strangely attired company
      forget their jaded decadence and sprawl across the table, digging their
      elbows into its scattered magnificence, following the gleam of her young,
      white body as it twists and turns beneath the whirling torch.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her gaze is bent always on Biseglia; her eyes are aslant and
      beckoning. Her bosom rises and falls more fiercely with the wrenching
      in-take of the breath. Will he never go to her?
    </p>
    <p>
      She flings back her hair from her shoulders; her body flashes like an
      unsheathed sword. Nearer and nearer to him she dances. His eyes rest on
      her moodily, half-closed. Does he make a movement, quickly she withdraws.
    </p>
    <p>
      She has flung away her torch and is spinning madly with her hands clasped
      behind her head. The grass is hidden with rose-leaves; she floats&mdash;her
      feet scarcely stir them. Suddenly she stops; stands erect for an ecstatic
      moment; sways dizzily; her strength is gone. Her hands, small and pitiful,
      fly up to cover her eyes. She shakes her hair free to hide her. Her body
      crumples. She is broken with her shame and futility. Biseglia leaps the
      table and has her in his arms as she falls, pressing his hot lips against
      hers. With clenched fists she smites him from her, slips from his embrace,
      and runs shimmering like a white doe through the forest of blackness.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a shout the revelers shatter the banquet and pour in pursuit of her.
      Biseglia leads them, darting ahead into the shadows. Dancing and singing,
      the disheveled bacchanalians stagger across the dark, trouping along dusky
      terraces with twining arms, following the fleeing dryad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Torches are burnt out and smolder in their sockets. Night is tattered by
      the dawn. Amid the havoc of trampled chalices and glass sprawls the
      wine-stained figure of the dead Lord of Pesaro&mdash;the man who, could
      she have loved him, would have given her all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>La Fiesole! La Fiesole!</i> We rose as one man as the curtain dropped.
      We did not care to think whether this was wrong&mdash;it was lovely. She
      had danced our souls out of their prejudices, out of their walls of
      restraint into chaos. The rapture of her beauty ran through our veins like
      wine. Our imaginations pursued her along pale terraces. The fragrance of
      crushed rose-leaves was in our nostrils and the coolness of night. Our
      breath came short, as though we had been running. Our senses were reeling
      and our eyes dazzled. We stood up in our places clutching at the air,
      calling and calling, hungry for the sight of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      For myself, I was smitten with blindness. My eyes saw the striving throng
      through a mist and probed into the beyond, where she ran on and on palely,
      forever from me. I shouted to her, but she grew more distant; never once
      did she look back or stay her footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was aware of a deep stillness&mdash;a hoarse peal of laughter: thousands
      of eyes glared up at me and down on me, and mouths gaped mockery. The mist
      cleared; Fiesole was standing before the curtain. The audience had grown
      hushed at sight of her while I had continued calling. From the stage,
      twenty feet away, she was smiling at me, insolent and charming, her body
      still shuddering with exertion beneath the velvet cloak which lay across
      her shoulders. What did I care, though to-morrow the whole of Paris should
      laugh? She had danced my soul into ecstasy. I placed my hands on the edge
      of the box and leant out drunkenly, shouting her name, &ldquo;<i>Fiesole!
      Fiesole!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kissed her hand at me derisively, bowed to the audience, and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sank in my place, a sickening nostalgia for her upon me. I did not
      reason; I only knew I wanted her&mdash;wanted her as she had once wanted
      me, with her hands and eyes and body. In a dim way I felt angry with
      myself for having lost her. She had made me disgusted with my coldness at
      Venice as I had watched my counterpart, the Duke of Biseglia. From the
      theatric torture in her face I had learnt something of how brutal a man
      may be when he fancies that he is righteously moral. She, whom I saw now
      so remotely, might have been mine; through these chilly years La Fiesole
      might have been my companion, had I had the faith to take what was
      offered. I had sought the things that were impossible. I had made a god of
      my scruples. I had sinned weakly, following Vi who did not belong to me. I
      had sat down to wait for her, and all the while Life was tapping at the
      door. I tasted Life to-night&mdash;&mdash; And who knows? Perhaps I had
      broken this woman&rsquo;s heart. I would no longer be niggardly. I would go to
      her; accuse myself to her; beat down her hatred of me; carry her off.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these thoughts trooped across my mind, the crooked sphinx-like smile
      of Paris wandered over me, examined me, hinted at tragedy with laughter,
      and widened its painted lips at my absurdity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtain rustled. The warning raps sounded. Lights sank, and heads bent
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a dim-lit room, chilly to the point of austerity, sat Lucrezia. Tall
      candles shone upon her face&mdash;a face purged of emotion, nunlike and
      wooden with an expression of distant contemplation. Behind her head was an
      open window through which floated in the sound of music. She heeded it not
      at all. In the far corner stood a bed with the curtains drawn back. At an
      altar a lamp burnt before a shining crucifix. Her women were unrobing her
      for the bridal night. They spoke to her, but she did not answer. They
      blamed her for her indifference to Biseglia: she had never kissed him,
      never caressed him since the night when she had won him. Did she not know
      that he hungered for her kindness?
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave them no answer. They lifted her this way and that as though she
      were a doll; she seemed to have forgotten her body. She might have been in
      a trance, leading a life separate, dreaming of things innocent and holy.
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one the candles were extinguished; only the lamp burnt before the
      altar. When her women were gone; she slipped from the bed and knelt with
      her head bowed before the cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      The music dies; silence falls. Along the passage comes a creeping
      footstep. The door opens; Biseglia enters, blinking his eyes at the room&rsquo;s
      dimness. He whispers her name. At last she hears him and rises, standing
      before the altar. He crosses the room reverently. He halts, gazing at her.
      He rushes forward, masters her, crushes her to him, and cries that she
      torments him&mdash;starves him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she makes no response, but lies pulseless in his arms, he carries her
      to the bed, incoherently claiming as his right the fondness she does not
      give him. Then he grows gentle and kneels before her, kissing her feet and
      calling her his god.
    </p>
    <p>
      She speaks. Her voice is small. &ldquo;Biseglia, thou didst love me only when I
      had made myself worthless that I might win thy fondness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He yearns up to her with his arms, disowning his former coldness,
      protesting that he adores her. She leans over him sadly; he raises his
      lips to hers. As she kisses him, her expression kindles to triumph. She
      withdraws her hand from her breast; the Borgian dagger sinks into his
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gazes stonily on the man who had once refused her. The lamp before the
      altar flickers and goes out. The room is plunged in darkness.

      CHAPTER VI&mdash;SIR GALAHAD IN MONTMARTRE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ong after the
      curtain had fallen I sat on. I had seen Antoine Georges step before the
      footlights leading Fiesole. I had seen him alternately bend above her hand
      and bow his acknowledgments to the applause. I did not like him, this fat
      little Frenchman, with his thin beard and spindly legs. The polite
      proprietorship of his bearing towards her had impressed me as offensive. I
      felt sure that he was smacking his lips and saying, &ldquo;They shall believe
      that it&rsquo;s all true, this that they say about us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the wings had come lackeys carrying garlands. They had built up a
      garden about her. The people had gone mad, standing up in their places and
      thunderously shouting. From all parts of the theatre flowers had rained on
      her. They had stormed her with flowers. Women had torn bouquets from their
      dresses and wreaths from their hair. It might have been a carnival; the
      air was dense with falling blossoms. And she had faced them with the smile
      of a pleased child, while Monsieur Georges bent double before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all over. Men were busy with brooms, sweeping up the litter of her
      triumph. This happened every night: they got used to it. Already in the <i>fauteuils
      d&rsquo;orchestre</i> perfunctory faded women were adjusting linen coverings.
      The last stragglers of the audience were reluctantly going through the
      doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man entered my box and tapped me on the shoulder. I stared up at him;
      his expression made me laugh. He evidently mistook me for a crank who was
      likely to give trouble. I reached for my hat and coat wearily; I felt that
      I had been beaten all over. As I folded my scarf about my neck I made bold
      to ask him where I could find Fiesole. He shrugged his shoulders, darting
      out his hands, palms upwards, as one who said, &ldquo;Ah, it is beyond me! Who
      can tell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it was important that I should see her, I urged; I was an old friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old friend! These days La Fiesole had many old friends. Were it
      permitted to her old friends to see her, all the messieurs would cross the
      footlights. He eyed me with impatience, anxious to see the last of me, his
      waxlike face wickedly ironic.
    </p>
    <p>
      I produced a fifty-franc note. Would it not be possible for him to deliver
      her a message?
    </p>
    <p>
      If Monsieur would write out his message he would make certain that La
      Fiesole got it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I scribbled my address on the back of a card, asking her to allow me to
      speak with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I folded the fifty-franc note about it and handed it to my tyrant. From
      the lack of surprise with which he accepted I gathered that he had
      pocketed greater amounts for a like service.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the street I paused irresolute. From my feet, could I follow it, a path
      led through crowded boulevards directly to her. I could not be very
      distant from her; a lucky choice of direction, the chance turning of a
      corner might bring us face to face. That I was in her mind was probable.
      She was remembering, as I was remembering, that day at Lido and that night
      at Venice. Was she satisfied with her revenge? She had always been
      generous. Somewhere in this passionate white night of Paris her car sped
      on through illumined gulleys; she lay back on cushions, her eyes
      half-shut, her mouth faintly smiling, picturing the past at my expense. I
      liked to think that she hated me; it was in keeping with her character; I
      respected her for it. The women who had loved me had made things too easy;
      it had always been I who had done the refusing. My blood was eager for the
      danger of pursuing. I longed for resistance that I might overcome her. I
      loved her with my body, I told myself, as I had never loved a woman; my
      cold, calculating intellectuality was in abeyance. That she should make my
      path of return difficult added a novel zest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The human tide was drifting towards Montmartre; I fell in and followed. On
      the pavement before cafés at little round tables <i>boulevardiers</i> were
      seated, sipping their absinthe, their eyes questing for the first hint of
      adventure. Taxis flashed by, soaring up &ldquo;the mountain&rdquo; like comets, giving
      me glimpses as they passed of faces drawn near together, ravishing in
      their transient tenderness. How was it? What had happened? For the first
      time in my remembrance I had ceased to analyze; I had ceased to sadden my
      present with foreknowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far away the Place Pigalle beckoned. Up tortuous streets, between ancient
      houses, the traffic streamed like a fire-fly army on the march. As I
      neared the top I entered the pale-gold haze of its unreality. Electric
      signs of L&rsquo;Abbaye, the Bal Tabarin, and the Rat Mort glittered on the
      night like paste jewels on the robe of a courtesan. Women trooped by me
      like blown petals, peering into my face and smiling invitation. I marked
      down their types in my mind by the names of flowers&mdash;jasmine, rose,
      poppy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was curiously transformed from that evening of long ago when I had
      watched these sights with horror, and had fled from Paris in the dawn to
      Florence. I felt no anger, no revulsion&mdash;only tolerance. I had
      finished with peeping beneath the surface. Fiesole had taught me to
      despise all that. <i>Fiesole! Fiesole!</i> I saw her always dancing on
      before me, mocking my sobriety. Yes, I told myself, she had made me
      kinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      A couplet from <i>Sir Galahad in Montmartre</i> dinned in my brain and
      summed up my estimate of my former self
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;He sees not the need in their faces;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &lsquo;Tis the sin and the lust that he traces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I had never looked for the need in any woman&rsquo;s face. I had been absorbed
      in contemplation of my own chastity&mdash;had hurried through life with
      hands in pockets, fearful lest I might be robbed. Vi&rsquo;s need, which I had
      recognized, I had made ten times more poignant. I had waited for her. What
      good had I done by it? I might go on waiting. Meanwhile there were Fiesole
      and Life knocking at my door. My constancy to Vi had become a luxury.
    </p>
    <p>
      A girl slipped her arm in mine. &ldquo;&lsquo;Allo! You zink I am pretty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was a <i>cocotte</i>, little more than a child, so delicate and
      slight. Her hair was flaxen and blowy; her complexion a transparent
      china-white; her dress décolleté and cut in a deep V between the breasts.
      She pushed her small face up to mine with the red lips parted, clinging to
      me with the innocent familiarity of one who had asked no more than a
      roguish question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zen we go togezer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pourquoi non?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hoping to meet someone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She released me at once with a good-natured smile. &ldquo;La! La! I hopes you
      find &rsquo;er.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tripped away, turning before she was lost in the crowd to wave her
      hand. I told myself that her flower was the jonquil.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one o&rsquo;clock when, after wandering about, I found myself back at the
      same place. I could not sleep; my brain was too active with excitement.
      Instead of being sad because of Fiesolè, I was unreasonably elated. I took
      a seat at a table on the pavement and ordered coffee and cognac. Every man
      and woman within sight was a lover, and I sat solitary. As the hour grew
      later men and women grew more frank in their embraces, and all with that
      naïve assumption of privacy which makes the Frenchman, even in his vices,
      seem so much a child. The sex-instinct beat about &ldquo;the mountain&rdquo;&mdash;the
      air quivered and pulsated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Girls rustled in the shadows. Lovers, chance-met, danced home together.
      Strange to say, I found nothing sinful in it&mdash;only romance. I had
      ceased to look beyond the immediate sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boy! You not find &rsquo;er?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked up; my lady of the jonquils was leaning over my shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh bien, peut-être, you find her to-morrow, <i>hein!</i> If not, zere are
      ozers.&rdquo; She waved her small gloved hands in a circle, bringing them back
      to include herself. She looked a good little soul, standing there so
      bravely disguising her weariness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tired?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ees nozing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you join me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Immediately we were in sympathy. She owned me with a playfulness which had
      no hint of indelicacy. Drawing off her gloves, she rested her chin on her
      knitted fingers and regarded me laughingly with her world-wise eyes. She
      was scarcely more than half my years, I suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zere are ozers,&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for me,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;not to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dieu! You are funny, my friend. You lofe like zat?&rdquo; The waiter hovered
      nearer, flirting his napkin across the marble-tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      I beckoned; he dashed up like a hen to which I had scattered grain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Croûte au pot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bien, Monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Filet aux truffes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bien, Monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salade romaine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bien, Monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vouvray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bien, Monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned to her. She had corn-flower eyes like Kitty&mdash;I had been
      wondering of whom I was reminded. I passed her my cigarette-case. She
      chose one fastidiously and tilted it between her lips with the smile of a
      <i>gamine</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we ate neither of us said much&mdash;she was hungry; but, as we
      sipped our coffee and the pile of cigarette ends grew, I found myself
      telling her&mdash;asking her if a man had refused her once, whether she
      could ever again love him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he haf a great heart, oui. If he haf not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She threw her
      cigarette away. &ldquo;C&rsquo;est la vie! Quoi?&rdquo; She snapped her fingers and leant
      over and took my hand, this gay little Montmartroise. &ldquo;But you haf; zo
      courage, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not want to be left alone; she knew it. A <i>fiacre</i>, with a
      battered race-horse propped between the shafts, had drawn up against the
      curb. On the box a red-faced <i>cocher</i> nodded. We climbed in and she
      nestled beside me. The <i>cocher</i> looked across his shoulder, asking
      where to drive. &ldquo;Straight on,&rdquo; I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      We crawled away down &ldquo;the mountain&rdquo;; as we went, she sang contentedly just
      above her breath. When we reached the Madeleine the <i>cocher</i> halted,
      inquiring gruffly whither he should drive. &ldquo;Tout droit. Tout droit&rdquo;; we
      both cried impatiently. So again we moved slowly forward. There was no
      doubt in the man&rsquo;s mind that we were mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew closer to me and cuddled into my coat; the foolish prettiness of
      her dress was no protection against the chill night air. We lay back, her
      head resting on my shoulder, gazing up at the star-scattered sky. The
      asphalt surface of the boulevard, polished by petrol and rubber-tires to
      the dull brightness of steel, glimmered in a long line before us
      reflecting the arc-lamps like a smooth waterway&mdash;like a slow canal in
      ancient Venice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where we went I do not know; I did not care to notice. The creaking <i>fiacre</i>
      had become a gondola and it was Fiesole who leant against me. Sometimes
      the <i>cocher</i> drew up to light a cigarette and to glance suspiciously
      down upon us. Then I was brought back to reality. We circled the Bastille
      and prowled through the <i>Quartier Latin</i>, where the night was not so
      late. We crossed the river once more and crept along the <i>Quai des
      Tuileries</i>; then again we climbed &ldquo;the mountain&rdquo; and plunged into the
      grimy purlieus of <i>Les Halles</i>. Market-carts were already creaking,
      in from the country with swinging lamps. Wagons piled high with
      vegetables, loomed mountainous under eaves of houses. From the market came
      grumbling voices of men unloading, and the occasional squealing of a
      stallion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>cocher</i> wriggled on his box and confronted me fretfully. Before
      he could ask his question, &ldquo;Sacré nom d&rsquo;un chien!&rdquo; I shouted fiercely,
      &ldquo;Allez. Allez.&rdquo; Meekly he jerked at the reins, sinking his head between
      his obedient shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked down at the tiny face beside me&mdash;the face of a white flower
      whose petals are folding. She had ceased her singing an hour ago. Feeling
      me stir, she struggled to open her eyes and slipped her small hand into
      mine. When I drew my arm tighter about her she sighed happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above the tottering roofs of Paris the night grew haggard. One by one
      stars were snuffed out. Wisps of clouds drove across the moon like witches
      riding homeward. It was the hour when even Paris grows quiet. Ragpickers
      were slinking through the shadows, raking over barrels set out on the
      curb. Women, shuddering in bedraggled finery&mdash;queens of Montmartre
      once, perhaps, whose only weariness had been too many lovers&mdash;dragged
      themselves to some sheltered doorway, thankful for a bed in the gutter, if
      it were undisturbed. In boulevards for lengthy pauses ours was the only
      sound of traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
      My head jerked nearer hers. Her breath was on my cheek; I could feel the
      twitching of her supple body. Poor little lady of the jonquils&mdash;of
      what was she dreaming? What had she expected from me? She would tell often
      of this eccentric night and no one would credit her story.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I awoke she was still sleeping. A spring breeze ruffled the trees;
      sparrows were chirping; a golden morning sparkled across the waters of the
      Seine. The sun, still ruddy from his rising, stood magnificently young
      among the chimney-pots, trailing his gleaming mantle beneath the bridges.
    </p>
    <p>
      The battered race-horse had stumbled with us just beyond the Louvre and
      stood with his head sagging between his knees, his body lurching forward.
      The reins had fallen from the <i>cocher&rsquo;s</i> hands; his thick neck was
      deep in his collar; and his face looked strangled. From across the road a
      waiter scattered sand between his newly set out tables and watched us with
      amused curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      My body was cramped. As I attempted to uncrook my legs, my companion
      opened her eyes and stared at me in amazed confusion. She yawned and sat
      up laughing, patting her mouth. &ldquo;Oh, <i>la, la</i>&mdash;-. Bonjour, toi!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We examined ourselves&mdash;I in my crumpled evening-dress, and she in her
      flimsy gown and decorative high-heeled shoes. I had a glimpse of my face
      in imagination&mdash;pale and donnish; the very last face for such a
      situation. How ill-assorted! Then I laughed too; the <i>cocher</i>
      lumbered round on his box and burst into a hoarse guffaw at sight of us.
      We all laughed together, and the waiter ceased sanding his floor to laugh
      with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We left the racer to his well-earned rest and all three went across to the
      café. As we soaked bread in our bowls of coffee and plied our spoons, we
      chatted merrily like good comrades. Then we parted with the <i>cocher</i>,
      leaving him agreeably surprised, and sauntered down the Quai where workmen
      in blue blouses, hurrying from across the bridges, found time to nudge one
      another knowingly and to smile into our eyes with a glad intimacy which
      was not at all offensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a narrow street where &ldquo;the mountain&rdquo; commenced, she halted and placed
      both her hands on my shoulders, tiptoeing against me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One &rsquo;as to go &rsquo;ome sometime, mon ami.&rdquo; She was determined
      to be a sportsman to the end. &ldquo;But remember, mon petit, if you do not find
      &rsquo;er, zere are ozers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I put my hand into my pocket. She examined what I gave her. &ldquo;Mais, non!&rdquo;
       she exclaimed, flushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But yes&mdash;for remembrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tilted up her face and her happy eyes clouded; the tired cheeks turned
      whiter and the painted lips quivered. &ldquo;Little one, keess me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I parted from this chance-met waif with her brave and generous heart&mdash;&mdash;
      And this was what my madness and Fiesole had taught me. For the time the
      memory of Vi was entirely banished from my thoughts.

      CHAPTER VII&mdash;SATURNALIA
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t my hotel I found
      no message. But it was still early; she might not have received my card
      and, as yet, did not know my address. The intoxication of the previous
      night still flicked my spirit into optimism&mdash;perhaps she would answer
      me in person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the reaction&mdash;the truer judgment. If she had desired to see
      me, she could have sent round word to my box at the theatre. After all,
      why should she desire to see me? She was famous and had made her world
      without me. When we parted, I had left her with a memory so humiliating
      that it must scorch her even now. These were things which a woman finds it
      difficult to forgive&mdash;impossible to forget. Still, there was
      curiosity&mdash;a woman&rsquo;s curiosity! She might resist it for a time,
      tantalizing both me and herself; but she would have to see me presently,
      if only to wound me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I scarcely stirred from my hotel, afraid lest I should miss her. By the
      time evening fell, I had come to a new conclusion&mdash;that the ironical
      scoundrel, who had so coolly pocketed my money, had destroyed my card. To
      make sure of reaching her, I wrote a letter to the theatre, saying many
      true things foolishly. Then, in sheer restlessness, I hurried to the
      boulevard in which her theatre was situated, hoping to get a glimpse of
      her either coming or going.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not bring myself to enter&mdash;it was too horrible and beautiful&mdash;she
      was dancing away her womanhood in there. Shockingly fascinated as I had
      been by the spectacle, I felt a lover&rsquo;s jealousy that strangers should
      watch it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hated the gay crowds seething in to find enjoyment in my shame and her
      tragedy. They were jesters at something sacred.
    </p>
    <p>
      I paced the boulevard with clenched hands and snapping nerves; I could not
      go far away from her, and I could not go to her. Within my brain she was
      always dancing, dancing, and the jaded eyes of Paris grew young with greed
      of her sensational perfection. I longed to go to her, to protect her, to
      save her from herself. She needed me, though she would scorn the idea if I
      told her. If she would but allow it, I would carry her away from these
      hectic nights and this subtle, soul-destroying sensualism. Her shame was
      my doing; I would give all my life to make amends to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she gave me no sign that she had either seen or heard from me. What
      else could I expect? How could I explain my infatuation even to myself,
      let alone to her, as more than physical attraction? And was it more?...
      Once she had offered me far more than I now begged; I had churlishly
      refused it. How could I account to her for my altered valuation of her
      worth? She would not answer&mdash;I knew that now. I should have to compel
      her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning in reading the papers I came across her name frequently. She
      was the madcap darling of Paris; every edition contained some anecdote of
      <i>La Fiesole</i> and her erratic doings. One item captured my interest
      especially: there was a certain café in the Champs Elysées to which she
      went often after theatre hours. For the time being she had made it the
      most fashionable midnight resort in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, having bribed heavily for the privilege, I was seated at a
      table near the entrance. If she came, she could scarcely pass without
      seeing me. The place was an <i>al fresco</i> restaurant, gorgeously
      theatric. It stood in a garden, brilliantly romantic and insincere as a
      stage-setting. Overlooking the garden were white verandahs,
      creeper-covered and garish with hothouse flowers; throughout it were
      scattered kiosks and bowers in which the more secret of the diners sat.
      The plumed trees were knit together with ropes of lights, like
      pearl-necklaces which had been tossed into their branches casually. In
      bushes and hidden among blossoms, glow-worm illuminations twinkled, like
      faeries kindling and extinguishing their lamps. Everything was subdued and
      sensuous. Fountains played and splashed. Statues glimmered. A gipsy
      orchestra, fierce-looking and red-coated, clashed frenzied music, which
      sobbed away into dreamy waltzes and elusive snatches of melody. The effect
      was bizarre&mdash;artistically unreal and emotionally tropic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here one might experience a great passion which consumed by its panting
      brevity; everyone seemed present for the express purpose of realizing such
      a passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      At tables seated in couples were extraordinary people, dressed to play
      their part in a dare-devil romance. Here were men who looked like Russian
      Archdukes, bearded, bloodless, and insolently languid. Sitting opposite
      them were voluptuous women, tragically exotic, dangerously coaxing, with
      the melodramatic appearance of scheming nihilists. They were reckless,
      these costly, slant-eyed odalisques&mdash;exiles from commonplace
      kindliness, born gamblers for the happiness they had thrown away and would
      never re-capture. There was the atmosphere of intrigue, of indiscreet
      liaison about almost every couple. They acted as though for one ecstatic
      moment the world was theirs. Their behavior was everything that is
      exaggerated, fond, undomestic, and arrogantly well-bred.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something lacking. As each new arrival entered, the slanted eyes
      of the women and the heavy eyes of the men were raised droopingly with an
      expression of furtive expectancy. They were a chorus assembled, waiting
      for the leading actor till the play should commence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Low rippling laughter, spontaneously joyous, sounded. From the trellised
      entrance she emerged and halted, looking mock-bashful, taking in the
      effect she had created, spurning the gravel with her golden slipper. Her
      gown was of dull green satin, cut audaciously low in the back and neck,
      and slashed from the hem to expose her slim ankle and golden stocking. She
      wore no jewels, but between her breasts was a yellow rose, which drifted
      nodding on the whiteness of her bosom&rsquo; as she drew her breath. Her reddish
      gold hair was wrapped <i>en bandeaux</i> about her small pale ears and
      broad pale forehead. It shone metallic; its brightness dulled and
      quickened as she swayed her splendid body.
    </p>
    <p>
      At her first appearance a muttering had arisen, gathering in volume. As
      she lifted her head and her green eyes flashed through her long, bronze
      lashes, we grew silent. It was as though a tamer had entered a cage of
      panthers and stood cowing them with her consciousness of power. Yes, she
      knew what they thought of her, and guessed what they admired in her. She
      surveyed us with quiet contempt. I felt that behind whatever she did or
      said there lay hidden a timid girlishness. She was still the old Fiesole,
      the happy companion who could tramp through rainstorms like a man. Her
      brave pagan purity these half-way decadents had not tarnished; by them it
      was unsuspected. I watched her tall, lithe figure; the neck so small that
      one could span it with a hand; the firm, high bosom, proud and virginal;
      the straight, frank brows, and the mouth so red and sweetly drooping.
      Other women looked decorative and tinsel beside her natural perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      My throat was parched. My eyes felt scalded. I was unnerved and a-tremble.
      Her beauty daunted as much as it challenged. What bond still existed
      between us that would draw her to me? She looked so remote, so hemmed in
      by the new personality she had developed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her green eyes swept the garden, probing its secret shadows. For whom was
      she looking? They rested on mine, absorbed me&mdash;then fell away without
      recognition. I had risen in my place, with head bent forward, ready to go
      to her at the least sign of friendship. I remained standing and staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to one of her companions and whispered something, at which they
      both laughed. He was a tall poetic-looking man, slight of hip, blue-eyed,
      and handsome. His hair was wavy and yellow, his face bearded, and his skin
      pale with excess. There were other men with her, Monsieur Georges among
      others; but on the poet alone she lavished her attention. She gave him her
      arm and came towards me with the undulating stride that I knew so well.
      For a second I believed she was going to acknowledge me; she went by so
      closely that her gown trailed across my feet and brushed my hands. It was
      cruelly intended. The play had opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The table that had been reserved for her was next to mine, partly hidden
      from the public gaze by bushes; as I watched, I caught glimpses of her
      profile, and could always hear the lazy murmur of her voice and
      occasionally fragments of what was said. I followed her foreign gestures,
      her tricks of personality&mdash;all of them adorably familiar: the way she
      shifted her eyebrows in listening, sunk her chin between her breasts when
      she was serious, and clapped her hands in excitement. She was as simple as
      a child&mdash;in her heart she had not altered. Even the way in which she
      made me suffer what she had suffered was childish. This pretending not to
      know me was so transparent. There were other and more subtle methods by
      which she could have taken her revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not the only man who attempted to spy on her; there might have been
      no other woman present. Languid faces scattered throughout the garden took
      on a new sharpness. They turned and looked down from balconies on La
      Fiesole, eager to catch glimpses of her. To their women-companions men
      listened with a bored pretense of attention. Perhaps it was because of
      this, in an effort to focus interest on themselves, that the women, as by
      a concerted plan, became more animated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a girl in scarlet leapt upon a table and commenced to dance with
      flashing eyes and whirling skirts. I heard someone say that she was a
      gipsy and that her brother was first-violinist in the orchestra. The music
      mounted up, wild and unrestrained; the small feet beat faster; the actions
      became more frenzied. She turned away from her comrade and bent back
      double, peering into his eyes; she flung herself from him, chaffing him
      with grim endearments; she feigned to become furious; then she threw
      herself across his knees exhausted, writhing her arms about his neck. Men
      eyed her with studied carelessness. She had done it before and they had
      applauded. They could see her any night. They could not always feast their
      eyes on La Fiesole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saturnalia broke loose. Girl after girl rose upon chair or table, or went
      swaying through the magic garden like a frail leaf harried by a storm.
      They danced singly, they danced together, going through grotesque
      contortions, beckoning lovers with their eyes and gestures.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I watched Fiesole through the bushes. She was not so indifferent to me
      as she pretended. She was playacting to rouse my jealousy; she was
      purposely scourging me into madness. I alone of the public was
      sufficiently near to see clearly what she was doing. She was luring her
      poet to recklessness, taking no notice of what was in process about her.
      Did I catch her eye, she looked past me without recognition. But him she
      enticed by her gentleness. The man was drunk with her favor and beauty. He
      trembled to put the thoughts of a lover into action; she challenged him
      with her eyes, warning him from her and beckoning him to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stooping over her, so low that his lips were in her hair, he whispered;
      but she shook her head. She rested her hand lightly on his shoulder, as
      though to steady him and to soften the unkindness of her refusal. Quickly
      he caught it in his own and bent over it, running his lips along her
      fingers and up her arm&rsquo;s smooth curves. She looked down on him unmoved,
      disdainful at his breach of manners, yet superbly amorous. Clutching her
      hotly to him, he kissed her on the throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blind anger shook me&mdash;lust for violence such as I had never felt.
      Breaking into the toy arbor where they sat, I remember standing over him,
      dragging him backward by the collar, so that his face glared up at mine
      empurpled. His friends rushed forward, beating me about the head and
      shoulders, tearing at my hands, trying to make me release my hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiesole had risen like a fury. The table went down with a crash. Her face
      was deadly pale and her green eyes blazed with indignation. Her hands were
      clenched as if she also were about to strike me. And I was pouring out a
      torrent of words, telling her swiftly how I loved her and all that she had
      made me suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her rage died away as she listened and her expression became inscrutable.
      Quickly she darted back her head, laughing without happiness, mockingly.
      &ldquo;You are very English, my friend. If you make so much noise, these
      messieurs will think we are married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I caught her by the wrists, so that she backed away from me. &ldquo;I wish to
      God we were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, la, la, la!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went off into a peal of merriment, pointing her finger at me. The
      crowd gathered round us uncertain, asking in half-a-dozen languages what
      had been the provocation and what we were saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her look changed. It was as though a mask had fallen. The temptress and
      witch were gone. I seemed to see in her melancholy eyes all the longing
      for tenderness and loyalty that I thought had been killed years ago in
      Venice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She advanced her face to mine and stared at me timidly, as though fearful
      she had been mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me out of this,&rdquo; she whispered hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her companions tried to intercept us, gesticulating and protesting. She
      brushed them aside, explaining that I was not myself and did not know what
      I was doing. For her sake they let me go without further molestation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We passed out, leaving them gaping after us. I helped her into her furs
      and took my place beside her in the coupé. Before we were out of earshot,
      the gipsy orchestra had swung into a new frenzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once Vi had kept me from Fiesole; now Fiesole was taking me from Vi. And
      these two women who, through me, had influenced one another&rsquo;s destinies,
      had never met. They were hostile types.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII&mdash;LA BELLE DAME SANS MERCI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> was at a loss
      what to say to her. Words could not bridge the gulf of more than five
      years that separated us. Now that anger had subsided, my genius for
      self-ridicule was at work. What a fool I had made of myself; how supremely
      silly I must appear in her eyes! It would be in all the papers to-morrow.
      How would she like that? Where was she taking me and why? Had she come
      with me simply to get me out of a public place before I committed worse
      violence?
    </p>
    <p>
      I pieced together phrases of apology and explanation, but remained
      tongue-tied. To express the emotions that stormed in my mind all words
      seemed insincere and inadequate. I was not sufficiently certain of her to
      venture either speech or action. I was fearful lest her mood might change
      to one of amusement. My nerves were on edge&mdash;I dared not risk that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noiseless as a ghost in a dream-world, the electric coupé drifted up the
      dully gleaming boulevard. I leant against the padded back and watched her.
      She sat erect, splendidly self-possessed, her profile framed in the
      carriage-window with the stealthy lights of Paris slipping by for
      background. Now she was no more than a blurred outline; now the
      acetylene-lamps of a swiftly moving car flashed on her like a
      search-light; now the twinkling incandescence of an illumined café flung
      jewels in her hair; now her face rested like sculptured ivory on the
      velvet blackness of the night. She was immobile; even the slender fingers
      clasped together in her lap never stirred. Our silence had lasted so long
      that it had ceased to be fragile; it rose between us, a wall of ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      We drew up against the curb. I had but a vague idea of where we were&mdash;near
      the Bois, I conjectured. Tall houses stood in shuttered dumbness along one
      side; on the other, trees shrank beneath the primrose dusk of arc-lights.
      She stepped out, ignoring my proffered assistance. She crossed the
      pavement and tapped; as the door swung back I followed her under an
      archway into a dim courtyard. Having mounted several flights of stairs,
      she tapped again. To the sleepy maid who opened she whispered hurriedly.
      The maid discreetly fell behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      We passed into a room delicately furnished. The floor was heavily carpeted
      in red. The walls, hung with etchings and landscapes, were paneled in
      white. Flowers stood about in bowls and slender vases; shaded lamps gave
      to the room a secret aspect. In the grate a fire of coals was burning and
      two deep chairs stood one on either side. The atmosphere was intensely and
      perishably feminine; it gave me the feeling of preparedness&mdash;as
      though I had been expected. Through tall windows the curious night stared
      in upon us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiesole crossed, making no sound save the silken rustle of her dress, and
      drew the curtains close together. She turned, looking back at me
      side-long, at once amused and languid. Her coldness and aloofness had
      vanished. The sparkle of mischief fetched the gold from the depths of her
      green eyes. Her body became expressive and vibrant. Then I heard her sweet
      hoarse voice, with its quaintly foreign intonation. It reached me
      tauntingly, lazy with indifference, holding me at arm&rsquo;s length. &ldquo;Dear man,
      take a chair by the fire and behave yourself. Mon Dieu, but you were
      amusing to-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed softly at remembering and shook her cloak from her white
      shoulders. A strand of hair broke loose and fell coiling across her
      breast. She stepped to a mirror, turning her back on me; having twisted it
      into place, she remained smiling at her reflection, whistling beneath her
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her gaiety cut like a lash across my mouth. I was painfully in earnest.
      She was treating the situation as an incident&mdash;a jest. To me it was a
      supreme moment&mdash;a turning-point: on what we should say to one another
      would depend the entire direction of both our lives. I was sorry for her
      beyond the power of words to express. The success and luxury of her way of
      living did not blind me to its hollowness and danger. Her frivolity left
      me affronted and fascinated. She roused in me all the unrestraint of the
      flesh; and yet I desired to worship her with my mind. I longed to carry
      her away from the fever and glare of streets to a place of quiet, where
      the world was blowy&mdash;where she might become what she had once been
      when I might have had her, genuine and fine. While these thoughts raced
      through my mind, the insistent question kept repeating itself, why had she
      brought me here to be alone with her at this late hour of the night?
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes flashed out at me maddeningly from the mirror. They prompted to
      irretrievable folly. They called me to go to her, and to be unworthy of
      both her and myself. And I knew why: she wished me to say and do the
      things that were unforgivable that she might have excuse to scorn me, to
      fling me from her. Once it had been my Puritanism that had thrust us
      apart; it should not now be my sensualism. I would not let her make a
      hypocrite of me in my own eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seconds ticked out the silence. Her dress whispered. Her voluptuous
      white arms, uplifted and curved above her neck as she patted her hair,
      enhanced the perfect vase-like effect of her body. I would not go to her,
      I told myself; I would not go to her. I held myself rigid, distraught, and
      tense. The blood swelled out my throat and beat in my temples. She
      withdrew her hands. Wickedly, like a shower of largesse, the clustered
      glory of her hair rained from her head, catching her in a net of
      smoldering brightness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced with half-closed eyes across her shoulder and feigned
      astonishment at observing that I had remained standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still the same old idjut! Wanting something you&rsquo;re afraid to have, and
      looking tragic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiesole, girl, don&rsquo;t you understand? It&rsquo;s not that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My voice sounded odd and strangled. I had spoken scarcely above a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      She swung about and surveyed me leisurely. There was a pout on her mouth
      like that of a naughty child. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re no longer amusing,&rdquo; she faltered;
      &ldquo;you grow tiresome. Why can&rsquo;t you be sensible, and sit down? I want to
      hear all this that you&rsquo;ve got to tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t make it easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her gleaming shoulders. &ldquo;Why should I? You made a horrid row
      about something that was none of your concern. You nearly choked a friend
      of mine to death. You don&rsquo;t expect me to say thank you, surely? I ought to
      punish you; instead, I bring you here. I wanted to have a look at you. Ah!
      but you were funny&mdash;so righteous and English! You made me laugh.....
      I can forgive anyone who does that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I did not answer, she regarded me puzzled. Slowly her brilliant
      deviltry and merriment faded. The laughter sank to a whisper and ceased
      abruptly, frightened at itself. The red lips drooped and parted. Something
      of my own pinched earnestness was reflected in her expression&mdash;it was
      as though her soul unveiled itself. She stole across to me wonderingly,
      her beautiful arms stretched out. She rested the tips of her fingers
      tremulously on my shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not true. You were splendid&mdash;so different from the rest.
      I&rsquo;m a beast. You made me ashamed of myself. That&rsquo;s why I was angry;
      because you, who made me what I am, should accuse me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accuse you! God forbid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made a movement to gather her to me, but she slipped past me and sank
      into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between us not that.&rdquo; She caught her breath. &ldquo;I hate you. I want to hate
      you. What else did you expect? But I can&rsquo;t. I cannot. You won&rsquo;t let me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to hate me. Call me what you like; it won&rsquo;t be worse than I
      deserve. I was cruel and selfish. I see it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook back her hair from her forehead and bent forward gazing into the
      fire, her elbows on her knees, her face cushioned in her hands. A sudden
      gravity and wistfulness had fallen on her. She was thinking, remembering,
      weighing me in the balance. I must not touch her&mdash;must not speak to
      her. If I showed any sign of passion, she would mistake it for pity either
      of her or of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to forget&mdash;to live you out of my life; but you&rsquo;ve brought
      it all back&mdash;the old bitterness and heartache. You didn&rsquo;t know what
      you did to me, Dante. You spared my body; you killed everything&mdash;everything
      else that was best. Look at me now.&rdquo; She glanced down at the exotic daring
      of her appearance:&mdash;the golden stocking that was revealed from ankle
      to knee by the narrow slash in the skirt; the splendid extravagant display
      of arms, throat, and breast that swelled up riotously, uninterrupted,
      snowy and amorous from the sheathlike dress&mdash;a flashing blade
      half-withdrawn from its scabbard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a devil. You made me that, you virgin man. No, don&rsquo;t speak&mdash;&mdash;
      I thought I should have died of shame after I left you. I could have
      killed you. You don&rsquo;t know how a woman feels when she&rsquo;s wanted a man with
      her whole soul and body, and she knows that she&rsquo;s beautiful; and he&rsquo;s
      flung her from him when she&rsquo;s offered herself, as though she were
      worthless. &lsquo;He didn&rsquo;t care,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;so nobody&rsquo;ll ever care.&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;
      And then I met Antoine Georges, who had known my father. And I did what
      you&rsquo;ve seen and I&rsquo;ve won success. When I saw you the other night I wanted
      to make you suffer. I&rsquo;ve often pictured how I would torture you if ever
      you should come back&mdash;how I&rsquo;d destroy you&mdash;how I&rsquo;d make you go
      through the same hell. And now you&rsquo;ve come, and I can&rsquo;t do it.&mdash;&mdash;
      I may change my mind presently. You&rsquo;d better go while I let you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m never going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head, scrutinizing my face stealthily from between her
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool. What about her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one else. There never will be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gasped. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t marry her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The strained look in her face relaxed. She laughed softly to herself; why
      she laughed I could not guess. It was not the laughter which follows
      suspense, but the laughter of one who courts danger. It was as though she
      parted her hair into sheaves and glanced out crying, &ldquo;I am Eve, the long
      desired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reaching over to the table she picked out a cigarette. When it was alight,
      she snuggled down into the chair, kicking off her little gold shoes and
      resting her feet on the fender. She eyed me dreamily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you made me suffer all that for nothing? You good men can be cruel.&mdash;&mdash;
      Tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Briefly I told her of my useless visit to Sheba; and why I left; and why I
      was still unmarried. I kept nothing back in my self-scorn and desire to be
      honest.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slipped her feet up and down the gleaming rail as she listened, lying
      deep in cushions, her cigarette tilted in her mouth, her hands clasped
      behind her head. When I ended, she frowned at me whimsically from beneath
      her drawn brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, you impracticable person, you might have foreseen all that. You
      didn&rsquo;t need to cross the Atlantic to discover that a husband doesn&rsquo;t let
      his wife be taken from him without making trouble.&mdash;&mdash; So you
      wouldn&rsquo;t pay the price to get her! You&rsquo;re a rotten reckoner, old boy, for
      a man who counts the cost of everything ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eye-lids flickered as her deep voice droned the words out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should put all that in the past tense, Fiesole. I&rsquo;m not counting
      anything to-night, penalties or pleasures. I&rsquo;m just a man who&rsquo;s wakened. I
      want something madly. Whatever it costs me or anybody else, I intend to
      get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You always wanted what you couldn&rsquo;t have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke lazily, blowing smoke-rings into the air, following them with
      her eyes and watching how they broke before they reached the ceiling. She
      appeared untouched by my emotion, as though nothing had been said that
      intimately concerned herself. She let her gaze wander, extending her lithe
      sweet length luxuriously, as though she had nothing to fear from my
      passion. I was crazed with desire, for all that I kept my tones quiet and
      steady. She maddened me with her indifference. It was all pretense&mdash;I
      knew it. She was playing a part with me, courting the inevitable, tempting
      me to reveal my hidden self. I watched her with clenched hands&mdash;suffering,
      yet finding fierce joy in the wonderful pride of her body. I would not
      have had her otherwise; the colder she appeared, the more I coveted her. I
      could have had her once for my wife, I reflected, had I chosen. I had
      tormented her; it was just that I should suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reticence of years fell away from me. I was kneeling at her side,
      kissing her unshod feet, her hands, her hair. Words tumbled from my lips,
      broken and unconsidered. I called her by foolish names such as are only
      used between lovers. I poured my heart out, speaking of the past and the
      future. I cursed myself, all the time repeating how I worshiped her&mdash;how
      I had loved her from a boy, but had come to know it only now.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she gave no sign of response: neither forbidding, nor assenting;
      letting me have my way with her without acknowledging my presence; a quiet
      smile playing round her lips; as completely mistress of herself as is a
      statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      I trembled into silence. She drooped forward, bending over me, just as she
      had done years ago in her uncle&rsquo;s summer-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, there are things that are offered only once. Five years ago I
      asked you for all that you are now asking. You were afraid of the price,
      as you were with the other woman. You refused me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s marriage I&rsquo;m asking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Then I asked for less.&mdash;&mdash; I&rsquo;m sorry. You ought to have
      gone when I told you. I felt that I should have to wound you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her gentle dignity stung me into strength. My turbulence died down. As I
      knelt, I flung my arms around her body and drew her to me. She struggled
      to draw back, but I held her so closely that my lips were almost on her
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Fiesole, I&rsquo;m unfair and I mean to be unfair. I was a brute to you
      once when I meant only to be honorable. To-night I&rsquo;m not caring what I am.
      You despise me&mdash;you can go on despising me, but I&rsquo;ll wear you out.
      I&rsquo;ll make you come to love me even against your will. You&rsquo;ll need me some
      day; I shall wait for that. I want to spend all my life for you; it&rsquo;s the
      only thing I ask of life now. Wherever you go I shall follow you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stopped, panting for breath. She had ceased to struggle. Her eyes were
      wide; her face hovered pale above me; she stared down at me powerless, yet
      with reckless challenge, breathing upon my mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a rotter to come back like this,&rdquo; she said hotly, &ldquo;just when I was
      beginning to be happy. When you speak of marriage, you don&rsquo;t know what
      you&rsquo;re saying. You spoilt all that for me years ago at Venice. D&rsquo;you think
      I&rsquo;ll ever believe again in the honor and goodness of a man? You&rsquo;ve come
      too late. Five years changes people. I&rsquo;m a different woman now&mdash;not
      at all what you imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can be any kind of woman you choose, but you&rsquo;re the woman I&rsquo;m going
      to marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you haven&rsquo;t heard what people say about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say I&rsquo;ve had lovers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if I should tell you that I have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t believe you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d prefer to think that I&rsquo;d lied to you rather than that I&rsquo;d told you
      the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would make no difference. You&rsquo;ve always loved me. You love me now. I
      know that you are pure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you would never doubt it? Never doubt it of a woman who dances every
      night, as I do, before the eyes of Paris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gazed at me curiously, with tenderness and intentness. Her bosom
      shuddered; I saw the sob rising in her throat. When she spoke, the words
      came slowly; her eyes were misted over; she trembled as I clasped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;you know, I believe you&rsquo;re the only living man who&rsquo;d be fool enough to
      say that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was always a fool, Fiesole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought she would have kissed me, her lips came so near to mine. &ldquo;But a
      dear fool, sometimes,&rdquo; she whispered hoarsely; &ldquo;a fool who always comes
      too late or too early&mdash;but a fool to the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood up and my arms slipped down to her knees as I held her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed brokenly. &ldquo;You nearly made me serious. It won&rsquo;t do to be
      serious at three o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go till you&rsquo;ve promised. Promise,&rdquo; I urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      She yawned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sleepy. You&rsquo;ve worn me out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But answer me before I go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled down at me mockingly, ruffling my hair. &ldquo;What a hurry he&rsquo;s in
      after all these years. Don&rsquo;t you ever go to bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me to-night. I must know. I can&rsquo;t bear the suspense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I put up with it for five years.&mdash;&mdash; Well, if you won&rsquo;t go home
      like a good boy, you won&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s a couch over there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She broke from me, leaving me kneeling with my arms empty. As the door
      opened into the room beyond I had a glimpse of the curtained bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I drew my chair closer to the dying fire. Behind the wall I could hear her
      steps moving up and down as she undressed. Now and then they paused; she
      was listening for the sound of my departure, uncertain, perhaps, whether I
      was still there. Some time had elapsed when the door opened gently. I
      twisted round. Her room was in darkness. She was standing on the
      threshold. Her feet were bare; she was clad in a white night-robe; across
      each shoulder, almost to her knees, hung down the red-gold ropes of her
      braided hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant what I said. I&rsquo;m not going till you tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her green eyes met mine roguishly. &ldquo;A persistent fool to-night,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the door was closing I threw after her, &ldquo;That morning in Venice.... I
      was going to have asked you to marry me; you were gone....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Left alone with the last flame flickering in the grate, I watched the
      little gold shoes.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX&mdash;THE GARDEN WITHOUT WALLS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he sun was
      streaming in across my shoulder. Someone had pulled back the curtains. I
      was stiff and stupid from my cramped position. Despite the morning, the
      electric-lights were still burning in the room; I blinked down at myself
      and was astonished to find that I was in evening-dress. As I eased myself
      up, something dropped to the floor&mdash;the gold shoes of Fiesole.
    </p>
    <p>
      From behind two warm arms fastened themselves about my neck, making me
      prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re up early, Dante C. You&rsquo;re a great, stupid juggins to sit up all
      night and spoil your temper, just when I want you to be more than
      ordinarily pleasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My temper&rsquo;s not spoilt. Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take your word for it. I&rsquo;ve got a secret to tell you. I&rsquo;m going on the
      spree to-day&mdash;going to be immensely happy. I want you to help. If
      you&rsquo;ve any of your tiresome scruples left over, you&rsquo;d best chuck &rsquo;em;
      or I&rsquo;ll find someone else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bit early, isn&rsquo;t it, to tackle a chap? I&rsquo;m too stupid to know what you
      mean. But I&rsquo;m game. How long&rsquo;s this spree to last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till it ends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;ll last forever, so long as it&rsquo;s just you and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dug the point of her chin into my shoulder. Glancing sideways, I
      caught the impish sparkle of her eyes and the glow of her cheeks, flushed
      with health and excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d like to kiss me,&rdquo; she whispered, bringing her demure red
      lips on a level with my mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, perhaps you&rsquo;d like to kiss me,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I attempted to rise, she restrained me. &ldquo;Not till I&rsquo;ve made my
      bargain and you&rsquo;ve agreed to my terms. I haven&rsquo;t made up my mind about
      you, so you needn&rsquo;t start talking marriage. Don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going to
      do with you, Dannie. So you&rsquo;re to come with me wherever I choose till I&rsquo;m
      tired&mdash;and you&rsquo;re to ask no questions. Understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never will be tired. I&rsquo;m coming with you always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll ask no questions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more than I can help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She released me. I stood up and surveyed my crumpled shirt-front; I was so
      obviously a reveler who had outstayed discretion. She went off into peals
      of laughter, laughing all over, showing her small white teeth, and
      clapping her hands. &ldquo;What have I done to you? You&rsquo;re a bottle of
      champagne; I&rsquo;ve pulled the cork out. I&rsquo;ll never get you all back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took her hands in mine, folding them together, and drew her to me.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never get any of me back. You&rsquo;ve made me love you. That&rsquo;s what
      you&rsquo;ve done, you adorable witch-woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, la, la! Don&rsquo;t talk like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help it. Don&rsquo;t want to help it. You&rsquo;ve made me mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old Dannie! Horrid of me, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tap at the door; the maid entered, bringing in rolls and coffee. I
      started away from Fiesole, but she held me. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t shock Marie; she&rsquo;s
      hardened; she&rsquo;s heard all about you, and some pretty bad things she&rsquo;s
      heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Over her coffee she grew thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I walk through Paris with a man in evening dress at ten in the
      morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d&rsquo;you want me dressed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In something gay. Light tweeds, brown shoes, and a gray felt hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got &rsquo;em all at my hotel. I&rsquo;ll slip back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slanted her eyes at me. &ldquo;Slip back to London, perhaps! No, Dannie, I
      don&rsquo;t trust you yet. I don&rsquo;t intend to lose you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose from the table and vanished into her bedroom. Marie followed.
      Through the partly closed door the excited titter of their whispered
      conversation reached me, scraps of nervously spoken French, and the
      opening and shutting of drawers and cupboards.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she re-appeared she was clad in a mole-colored suit of corduroy
      velvet, gathered in at the waist and close-fitting to her modish figure.
      The tube-skirt hung short to her ankles and was trimmed about with fur.
      The suède shoes, open-work stockings, and large muff were to match.
      Nestling close to her auburn hair was a huzzar cap of ermine. She halted
      in the sunlight, eyeing me with the naughty modesty of a coquette. She
      looked oddly young and distinguished on this rare spring morning. There
      never was such a woman for arranging her temperament to suit her dress.
      Her hectic manner of high spirits was abandoned; she seemed almost shy as
      she raised her muff to her lips and watched me, while I took in the
      effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I meet with your approval?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Passing down the stairs, she hugged my arm impulsively&mdash;a trick which
      brought memories of Ruthita. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully jolly to be loved&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the door a powerful two-seated car was standing. The chauffeur
      stepped out; Fiesole took his place at the wheel. As we drove down the
      boulevards she was recognized; people on the pavements paused to gaze
      back; men raised their hats and threw glances of inquiry at one another as
      to the identity of her strangely attired companion. We drew up at my hotel
      in the Rue St. Honoré.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you fifteen minutes. Is that sufficient? Make yourself gay. Don&rsquo;t
      forget, a tweed suit, brown shoes, a gray felt hat&mdash;oh, and a red tie
      if you&rsquo;ve got one. I couldn&rsquo;t endure anything black.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I found her with her eager face turned towards the doorway, watching
      impatiently for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good beginning&mdash;ready to the second. Jump in. We&rsquo;re off to
      somewhere where no one&rsquo;ll know anything about us. Let&rsquo;s see if we can&rsquo;t
      lose ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She swung the car round and away we snorted, through the Place de la
      Concorde blanched in sunlight, up the Champs Elysées where sunlight
      spattered against blossoming trees and lay in pools on the turf. The
      streets were animated with little children, women in bright dresses,
      dashing cars and carriages. Paris gleamed white and green and golden.
      Overhead the sky foamed and bubbled, yawning into blue and primrose
      gulleys, trampled by stampeding clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Place de l&rsquo;Etoile the car drew up sharply and skidded; circled like
      a hound picking up the scent; then darted swiftly away to the Bois, where
      fashionables already loitered and acacias trembled murmurously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiesole was radiant with impatience. A goddess of speed, she bent above
      the wheel, casting her eyes along the road ahead. Did a gap occur in the
      traffic, she flung the car forward, driving recklessly, yet always with
      calculated precision. I marveled at her nerve and the silent power that
      lay hidden in her thin, fine hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we shot the bridge at St. Cloud the pace quickened. It was as though
      she shook Paris from her skirts and ran panting to meet wider stretches of
      wind-bleached country. I had one vivid glimpse of the ribbon of blue
      river, boat-dotted, winding through young green of woodlands; then cities
      and sophistication, and all things save Fiesole, myself, and the future
      were at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the white road curved uninterrupted before us, a streak between
      pollarded trees and blown meadows. Over the horizon came bounding hills
      and church-spires, villages and rivers; as they came near to us they
      halted, like shy deer, for a second; when we drew level, they fled. It was
      as though we were stationary and the world was rushing past us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind of our going brought color to her cheeks and fluttered out her
      hair. Her eyes were starry, fixed on the distance as she skirted the rim
      of eternity in her daring. Should an axle break or a tire burst, all this
      fire of youth would be extinguished forever. I glanced at the speedometer;
      it quivered from seventy to eighty, to eighty-five kilometers, and there
      it hovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The throb of the engine seemed the throb of my passion. We were traveling
      too fast for talking. She did not want to talk; she was escaping from
      something, memories, perhaps&mdash;hers and mine. In her modern way she
      was expressing what I had always felt: the tedium of captivity, sameness,
      and disappointment&mdash;the need for the unwalled garden, where barriers
      of obedience and duty are broken down.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Evreux we halted for petrol. I proposed déjeuner, she shook her head
      naughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over there, to the West.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any particular spot in the West?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about the theatre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time enough,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke breathlessly, remaining at the wheel while the man was filling
      the tank. Somehow it seemed to me that the town had come between us; we
      understood one another better when the garden of the world was flying past
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the man was paid, she had turned on the power. As we lunged
      forward, he jumped aside and I flung the money out. Our wild ride towards
      the Eden of the forbidden future recommenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, without turning her head, she broke the silence. &ldquo;Slip your arm
      round me, old boy; my back grows tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I placed my arm about the slender, upright figure and slid my shoulder
      behind her, so she leant against me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea, Fiesole? Paolo and Francesca?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Adam and Eve, if you like; and Dan Leno and Herbert Campbell; and
      Joseph Parker and Jane Cake-bread. Anything, so long as we keep going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I attempted to speak again, she turned on more power and threw me a
      smile which was a threat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I clasped her closer. &ldquo;Little devil! I&rsquo;ll keep quiet. You needn&rsquo;t do
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But though I kept quiet my heart beat madly. The panorama of change
      sweeping by, with her face the one thing constant, quickened and
      emphasized my need of her more than any spoken tenderness. Our thoughts
      merged and interchanged with a subtlety that speech could never have
      accomplished. The pressure of her body, the tantalizing joy of her
      nearness and forbiddenness, the imminence of death, the law of silence&mdash;these
      summed up in a moment&rsquo;s experience the entire philosophy of love, and of
      life itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to understand her meaning, her language; she was temporizing as I
      had temporized at Venice; but instead of going away from me, she was
      fleeing with me from circumstance. She was telling me of her woman&rsquo;s pride&mdash;her
      difficulty to make herself attainable after what had happened. She loved
      me and she hated me. She drew me to her and she thrust me from her. She
      could not forget and she dreaded to remember. And she said all this when,
      in escaping, she took me with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I saw nothing of the hurrying landscape; I watched her. I wrote all
      her beauty on the tablets of my mind&mdash;nothing should be unremembered:
      the way her curls crept from under her cap and fluttered about her
      temples; the clear pallor of her forehead; the firm, broad brows; the
      quiet challenge of her deep-lashed eyes; how her red mouth pouted and her
      head leant forward from her frail white neck, like a flower from its
      stalk, in a kind of listening expectancy. And I observed the tender
      swelling of her breasts, high and proud, yet humble for maternity; and the
      pliant strength of her supple body; and her long clean limbs; and the
      delicately modeled feet and ankles, which shot out from beneath her
      fur-trimmed skirt&mdash;the feet of a dancer, graceful and fragile as
      violins.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was mad. I wanted her. No matter how she came to me, I wanted her. I
      could not bear the thought that we should ever be separated. She was so
      intensely mine at this present; and yet, though she was mine, I was
      insanely jealous to preserve her.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the long fascination of watching her I bent slowly forward. The
      action was instinctive, uncalculated. How long I took in approaching her,
      I cannot tell. I was anxious to last out the joy of anticipation; I was
      not conscious of motion. My lips touched hers. Her hold on the wheel
      relaxed. Her eyes met mine. The car swerved, hung upon the edge of the
      road, ran along it balancing; then bounded back into the straight white
      line.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was so frenzied that I did not care. She had thought to hold me prisoner
      by her speed; I would overcome her with defiance. I kissed her again,
      holding her to me. She kept her eyes on the distance now, but her mouth
      smiled tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was foolish,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I raised my voice to reach her above the moaning of the engine. &ldquo;The whole
      thing&rsquo;s foolish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She broke into wild laughter. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I like it, like you, like
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We hovered on the brim of a valley; then commenced to sink as though the
      earth had given way beneath us. Far below, as far as eye could reach, were
      orchards smoking with white blossom. Through the heart of the valley a
      river ran; standing on its puny banks was a gray old town, blinking in the
      wind and sun like a spectacled grandmother who had nodded to sleep, and
      wakened bewildered to find spring rioting round her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lisieux, unless I&rsquo;m mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you know where we&rsquo;re going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More or less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We pulled up in a drowsy, sun-drenched market-place outside a sleepy café.
      At tables on the pavement, with hands in their blouses and legs sprawled
      out, sat a few artisans, eyeing their absinthe. Houses tottered and sagged
      from extreme old age. Across the way a cathedral, scarred by time and
      chapped by weather, raised its crumbling sculptured towers against the
      clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took my hand as she stepped out. &ldquo;You nearly did for us just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who cares?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;All Paris cares. I&rsquo;m not anxious to be dead;
      when I am, I&rsquo;d like to look pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we had seated ourselves, she took out her mirror and commenced
      tidying her hair and brushing the dust from her brows. There was nothing
      to be had, the waiter informed us, but pot au feu; déjeuner was over. So I
      ordered pot au feu, red wine and an omelet.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she replaced her mirror in her muff, she looked up brilliantly. &ldquo;You
      know, I <i>am</i> pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was being watched. The dull eyes of the absinthe-drinkers had become
      alert. Tradesmen had come out of their shops and stared at her across the
      square. Some of the bolder strolled into the café and seated themselves
      close to her. They were paying the unabashed homage that a Frenchman
      always pays to feminine beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lowered my voice to a whisper; my throat was parched with dust. &ldquo;This
      can&rsquo;t go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed with her eyes. &ldquo;It can go on as long as there&rsquo;s any petrol
      left, and as long as you don&rsquo;t try to kiss me when I&rsquo;m speeding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I meant; you know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then? The same old thing&mdash;marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I ignored her flippancy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be turning back directly, and when you
      get to Paris, you won&rsquo;t be like you are now. You&rsquo;ll be <i>La Fiesole</i>
      and to-night you&rsquo;ll be dancing with them all watching. I can&rsquo;t bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I leant eagerly forward, but she drew away from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going back? You&rsquo;ve given up the theatre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held me in suspense, letting her eyes wander as though she had not
      heard. Slowly she turned, with that lazy, taunting smile of hers. &ldquo;Damn
      the theatre,&rdquo; she said quietly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going on with you to the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the end&rsquo;s marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can tell? Now don&rsquo;t be a rotter. You&rsquo;re spoiling everything. Let&rsquo;s
      talk of something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we climbed into the car, &ldquo;You drive,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my secret. Straight on. I&rsquo;ll tell you when to turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were hardly out of the valley before her eyes had closed and her head
      was nodding against my shoulder. I drove gently, fearing to disturb her.
      From time to time I looked down at the white slant of her throat, the
      shadows beneath her lashes, and the almost childish droop of her mouth.
      How the self she kept hidden revealed itself! Her face was that of a
      Madonna, for whom the cross was yet remote and the happiness near at hand&mdash;and
      both were certain. What different versions she gave me of herself! Once a
      sickening fear shook me like a leaf. I slowed the car to a halt, and
      listened for her breath. In that moment I suffered all the agony of loss
      that must some time accompany the actuality. One day, sooner or later, I
      told myself, this thing I had dreaded would occur. How much time was left
      to us to find life beautiful between then and now?
    </p>
    <p>
      On the bare Normandy uplands, between tilled fields and driving clouds, I
      waited for her to waken. The air was growing chill; I drew my coat round
      her. I felt again, in a new and better way, that sense of nearness and
      forbiddenness which had exhilarated me to the point of delirium on the
      madcap journey down from Paris. I looked ahead into the pale distance,
      where the notched horizon bound the earth with a silver band ... and I
      wondered where she was taking me, and what lay at the end. She might fight
      against it&mdash;she would fight against it; but the end should be
      marriage. I would watch over her always as I was watching now.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stirred; her eye-lids fluttered. She stared up at me for a moment with
      undisguised affection; then the fear of tenderness returned. She pulled
      herself together, rubbing her knuckles in her eyes and yawning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee up, old hoss. This ain&rsquo;t a bloomin&rsquo; cab-stand. You&rsquo;re not home yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fell asleep, my dear, so I waited for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I shan&rsquo;t pay you,&rdquo; she laughed; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not fair. Pray what did you
      think you were doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enjoying myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the difference; you like to crawl, I like to hurtle. You&rsquo;re a
      tortoise; I&rsquo;m a razzle-dazzle. We&rsquo;re an ill-matched pair. Living in Pope
      Lane has made you pontifical. Oh, Dannie, in ten years your tummy&rsquo;ll be
      bulgy and your head&rsquo;ll be bald. Pope Lane&rsquo;ll have done it. I know what
      I&rsquo;ve always missed about you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something horrid? Let&rsquo;s have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cowl. You ought to have been a monk in Florence, painting naked angels
      in impossible meadows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So kind of you. Religion mixed with impropriety! If there was someone to
      relieve me of my conscience, it wouldn&rsquo;t be half bad. But I don&rsquo;t live at
      Pope Lane any longer. You have the honor of sitting beside Sir Dante
      Cardover of Woadley Hall, Ransby, of which, you little wretch, you are
      soon to be mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That so? Sorry I spoke. Jump out and crank up the engine. It&rsquo;s coming on
      again&mdash;you&rsquo;re going to have the sentimentals, and you&rsquo;re going to
      have &rsquo;em bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known you sentimental, Fiesole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her lips trembled, and her body stiffened. &ldquo;And you punished me for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a woman&rsquo;s memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Odd, seeing I&rsquo;m a woman. Who&rsquo;s going to crank that engine? Am I, or are
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We swung on through the bare bleak country with masked faces. She sat a
      little apart from me, her knees crossed and her hands clasped about them.
      Did I glance at her, she turned petulantly in the opposite direction. I
      cursed myself. I was almost angry with her. What was her plan? Had she
      given me the privileges of dearness to her simply that she might thwart
      and taunt me? How could I teach her to forget? How could I teach myself to
      forget? At the back of my mind I loved her the more because of her
      perversity.
    </p>
    <p>
      We came to a cross-road. She touched me on the arm; we swerved into it.
      Far down the white stretch I saw a speck, which resolved itself into a man
      and woman, traveling away from us with their backs towards us. The man
      wore the blue blouse and wide, baggy trousers of a peasant; his feet were
      shod in sabots. The woman was clad in a coarse, loose dress, like a sack
      drawn over her and tied about the middle; it was neutral in tone, being
      aged Ly weather. Her figure was shapeless&mdash;almost animal in its
      ponderous patience and breadth. Her hair was flaxen from exposure. They
      plodded through the bleak expanse with heads bowed, bodies huddled, and
      arms encircling. Every few paces they halted; we saw the gleam of their
      faces as they clung lip to lip in hasty ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind was blowing from them towards us; they were unaware of us. I had
      my hand on the horn, when Fiesole clutched me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;ve nothing in the world but this moment. God knows what lies
      before them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We followed them at a distance. The symbolism of their silent figures awed
      us: overhead, the soundless battle of high-flying clouds; beneath, the
      gray vacancy with springtime stirring; around, the dun, unheeding earth;
      through the bareness the white road sweeping on unhurrying toward the land
      of sunsets; traveling along it a man and woman, for the time forgetful of
      their poverty, the focus-point of responsive passion. They had nothing but
      this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what have we?&rdquo; I questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      She crouched beside me; her soft arm stole about my neck. &ldquo;Dearest,
      forgive me,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were blinded; my lips against her cheek were salt. She clung to
      me desperately, as though a hand pressed on her shoulder to jerk her from
      me&mdash;Vi&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where a rutted lane sloped down to a wooded hollow, the lovers turned.
      Among pollarded trees we lost them. They would never know that we had
      watched them. So they vanished out of our lives, walking hand-in-hand
      toward child-bearing and the inevitable separation of death that lurked
      for them at some hidden cross-road. We, equally unknowing, to what place
      of parting were we faring?
    </p>
    <p>
      I tilted up her face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a selfish fool. I&rsquo;ll never speak another
      word about marriage or anything that will pain you. Oh, Fiesole, if you
      could only love me&mdash;love me as I love you&mdash;as though there was
      nothing else left!&rdquo; She took my hands in her small ones, pressing them to
      her breast, quoting in a low sing-song, &ldquo;Laugh, for the time is brief, a
      thread the length of a span. Laugh and be proud to belong to the old proud
      pageant of man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like that&mdash;&lsquo;the old proud pageant of man.&rsquo; I wonder where you got
      it. But is there to be nothing deeper between us than laughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we do the laughing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;life&rsquo;s ready to do the rest. But
      you&rsquo;re a puritan at heart: you suspect that gladness is somehow unholy.
      Don&rsquo;t you know, Mr. Bun-yan, that laughter is the language they speak in
      heaven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t; neither do you. But when you say so laughing, I can almost
      believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we had once again started, she became more frank. It was because my
      hands were occupied, perhaps. Laying her cheek against my shoulder,
      &ldquo;Dante, I&rsquo;m not a flirt,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t make up my mind about
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe, I&rsquo;ll make it up for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe. But I want you to understand why I did what I did this morning&mdash;speeding
      like that and behaving as though I was cracked. I was afraid you were
      going to make love to me every moment&mdash;and I didn&rsquo;t want it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;you want it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; She dragged the words out wide-apart. &ldquo;And yet I do know;
      but I&rsquo;ve no right to allow it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You silly child, why on earth not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m inconstant; I&rsquo;m like that now. I should make you happy first and
      sorry afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll risk it. I made you sorry first and now I&rsquo;m going to make you
      happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The road began to descend, at first gradually. The bare, tilled uplands
      where winter lingered, were left behind and we ran through a sheltered
      land of orchards. The air pulsated with the baaing of lambs and the sweet
      yearning of fecundity. Under blown spray of fruit-trees the little
      creatures gamboled, halting by fits and starts, calling to their mothers,
      or kneeling beneath them, their thirsty throats stretched up and their
      long tails flapping. Surrounded by lean trees, lopped of their lower
      branches, gray farmhouses rose up, watching like aged shepherds.
      Slowfooted cattle, heavy-uddered, wandered between the hedges with their
      great bags swinging. Women with brass jars on their shoulders, which
      narrowed at the neck like funeral urns, walked through the meadows to the
      milking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do we turn or go on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much farther?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little farther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting older and older isn&rsquo;t it, Fiesole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, younger and younger, stupid. Look at all the lambs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before us the land piled up into a hillock, breaking the level sweep of
      sky-line and hiding what lay beyond. The road curved about it in a slow
      descent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiesole leant past me, shutting off the power. &ldquo;Let her coast,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the bend in the road I jammed on the brakes, halting the car. She
      slipped her hand into mine; we filled our eyes with the sight, saying
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sheer against the sky rose a jagged rock and perched on its summit, so
      much a part of it that it seemed to have been carved, stood a ruined
      castle. Its windows were vacant; its roof had long since fallen; its walls
      had been bruised and broken by cannon. It tottered above the valley like a
      Samson blinded, groping on the edge of the precipice, its power shorn.
      Round the embattled rock, like children who trusted the old protector,
      gathered mediaeval houses. Some of them, centuries ago, had wandered off
      into the snowy orchards and stood tiptoe, as though listening, ready to
      run back should they hear the tramp of an invading army. Through the
      valley and into the town a narrow stream darted, flashing like an arrow.
      Behind town and castle, across the horizon, towered a saffron wall of
      cloud, tipped along the edge with fire and notched in the center where the
      molten ball of the setting sun rested. From quaint gray streets came up a
      multitude of small sounds, like the lazy humming of women spinning. And
      over all, across orchards and roofs of houses, the grim warden on the rock
      threw his shadow. It was a valley forgotten by the centuries&mdash;a
      garden without barriers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; I whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Falaise, my darling. I always promised myself that if ever I should love
      a man, I would bring him to Falaise to love him. Can&rsquo;t you feel it&mdash;the
      slow quiet, the sense of the ages watching?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was aflame in the light of the sunset. Her face was ivory, intense and
      ardent with glory. Her waywardness and fondness for disguise were gone;
      her true self, steady and unafraid, gazed out on me. The havoc of passion
      was replaced by the contentment of a desire all but satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the castle first,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You remember its story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I remembered: how Robert the Devil, Duke of the Normans, had found
      Arlotta, the tanner&rsquo;s daughter, washing linen in that same little beck;
      and had loved her at sight and had carried her off to his castle on the
      rock, where was born William the Bastard, conqueror of England and
      greatest of all the Normans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the car in the village street, we climbed the rock and gained
      admittance. As we gazed down from the splintered battlements into the
      winding streets, Fiesole drew me to her, throwing her arm carelessly about
      my neck as though we were boy and girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; she whispered, pointing sheer down to the foot of the precipice,
      &ldquo;there&rsquo;s the tannery still standing and the beck running past it. And see,
      there are girls washing linen; one of them might be Arlotta. In nine
      hundred years nothing has altered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We stole across the threshold of the stone-paved room in which the
      Conqueror was born. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to shock you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I always think of
      Falaise as another Bethlehem&mdash;the Bethlehem of war. The Bethlehem of
      peace has crumbled, shattered by war; but here&rsquo;s Falaise unchanged since
      the day when Robert the Devil seized Arlotta and galloped up the rock, and
      bolted his castle door. It sets one thinking&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinking something dangerous, I&rsquo;ll warrant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She brushed the rebellious curls from her forehead and leant back against
      the wall laughing. &ldquo;Thinking all kinds of thoughts: that it pays best in
      this world to steal what you want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;if you steal strongly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have stolen strongly; see how I&rsquo;ve carried you off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We discovered a little hotel, the courtyard of which was invaded by a
      garden and opened out beyond into a misty orchard. At sound of our
      entrance a white-haired old country-woman came out from the office,
      holding her knitting in her hands. I made to go towards her, but Fiesole
      detained me. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my prisoner,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m responsible. You stay
      here and I&rsquo;ll tell her what we want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The air had grown sharper, but the moments were too precious to be spent
      indoors. We had our dinner served beneath a fig-tree in the courtyard,
      where we could see the shadows creeping through the garden and hear the
      sabots clap along the causeways.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were almost shy with one another. We had little to say, and that little
      was spoken with our eyes for the most part. We did not dare to think: for
      me there was the ghost of Vi; and she also had I knew not what memories.
      We were restless till the meal was ended; the contact of live hands was
      the best speech possible. The tremulous dusk had fallen when we wandered
      out into the narrow climbing streets, traveling directionless under broken
      archways, past ancient churches&mdash;bribes to God for forgiveness for
      wrongs still more ancient.
    </p>
    <p>
      We peeped into crouching cottages as we passed. We were glad of their
      company; they kept us from giving way to the tumult of feeling that ran
      riot in our hearts. Their small leaded windows were like lanterns set out
      to guide and not to watch us. We had glimpses through the glowing panes of
      kindly peasant interiors, with low ceilings and home-made furnishings.
      Sometimes at a rough table round which wine and bread were passed, the
      family was gathered, their faces illumined by a solitary candle in the
      center; looming out of the shadows on the wall was the cross. Sometimes
      the man was still at work, carving sabots or weaving, while the woman held
      a child to her breast, or rocked it in a cradle on the stone-paved floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one the lights were quenched and the doors fastened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiesole leant more heavily against me, her arm encircling me, her head
      upon my shoulder. Now that the town slept, I could feel the wild clamor of
      her body and hear the fluttering intake of her breath. The wind,
      whispering through flowering trees, blew cool and fragrant in our
      nostrils. For intervals there was no sound save the rustle of falling
      blossoms and our own stealthy footsteps; from somewhere out in the pale
      dusk, a lamb would call and its mother would answer. Above us, between
      steep roofs, as down a beaten pathway, the silver chariot of the moon
      plunged onward, scattering the clouds before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We came again to the hostel; when we entered, we walked apart. Quickly, as
      though seized with sudden misgiving, Fiesole left me. I heard her footstep
      mounting the stairs and saw the light spring up in her window. Every other
      window was in darkness. From where I sat in the courtyard I could see the
      shadow of her figure groping, and her arms uplifted as she unbound her
      hair. The light went out. I wondered if she watched me. I listened to hear
      her stirring; I could hear nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dim quiet, shut out from the excitement of her presence, I had
      leisure to reflect on whither I was going. I drew apart from myself and
      eyed my doings impartially. It was a whim of curiosity that had brought me
      to Paris&mdash;one of those instinctive decisions which construct a
      destiny. The sight of her as Lucrezia had stabbed me to remorse, and then
      to folly. That she had hated me up to last night and that the desire of
      her wild heart had been to torture me, I did not doubt; but I thought that
      there were moments in this day when she had loved me with the old
      uncalculating kindness. What was her intention now?
    </p>
    <p>
      Unaccountably out of the past, Fiesole had returned&mdash;Fiesole, the
      girl-woman I had loved as a boy before Vi. I felt like a broken gamester
      who has discovered an overlooked coin in his pocket after having believed
      himself penniless. So strange was this happening that it could not be
      fortuitous&mdash;we had met because we had been piloted.
    </p>
    <p>
      All seeming failure of the past would take on an aspect of design and
      would appear a straight road leading to this moment, were our journeyings
      to end in marriage. And, though she would not own it, she needed the
      protection of a man who loved her to guard her against her success and
      self-reliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      My thoughts ran on, picturing the home and little, children we would have.
      Children would be walls about our love, making it secure. For these I was
      hungry&mdash;desperately afraid lest the hope of them should be withdrawn.
      In imagination they seemed already mine, I would speak my heart out: she
      should understand before it was too late that my need was also hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      I entered the hostel. In the office the old woman nodded above her
      knitting. I roused her and asked for my candle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Monsieur,&rdquo; she said in apology, &ldquo;I had not thought. For a room so
      small I supposed that one would be sufficient. I have given Madame the
      candle. If Monsieur will wait, I will fetch another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In my surprise I told her that it did not matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt my way up the unlit stairs. At the bedroom-door I knocked.
      Fiesole&rsquo;s voice just reached me, whispering to me to enter. On the
      threshold I paused, peering into the darkness. The floor was bare; there
      was little furniture. In the shadows against the wall, a canopied,
      high-mattressed bed loomed mountainous. Through the window, reaching
      almost to my feet, a ray of moonlight slanted; in it, gleaming white,
      stood Fiesole.
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart was in my throat. I could not speak. We watched one another; as
      the silence lengthened, the space between us seemed impassable.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held out her arms; her hoarse voice spoke, yearning towards me with
      its lazy sweetness. &ldquo;Even now, if you want to, you may go, Dannie.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X&mdash;THE FRUIT OF THE GARDEN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> had been for a
      saunter through the town. Several times I had returned before I found
      Fiesole beneath the fig-tree in the courtyard, seated at the table with a
      paper spread out in front of her. She looked up swiftly at sound of my
      footstep and threw me a smile, gathering herself in to make room for me
      beside her. When I stood over her, she lifted up her face with childish
      eagerness as though we had not kissed already more than once that morning.
      &ldquo;Shall I order déjeuner out here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;Where else, but in the sunshine?&rdquo; When I came back from
      giving the order, her red-gold head was bent again above the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something interesting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather.&rdquo; She raised her green eyes mischievously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all up. We&rsquo;ll be
      collared within the hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all up? Who&rsquo;s got the right to collar us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paris thinks it has, the whole of France thinks it has, but most
      particularly Monsieur Georges thinks he has, and so does the
      theatre-management.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let &rsquo;em try. We don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, old boy, I do care a little. You see, I shouldn&rsquo;t have been here now
      if it hadn&rsquo;t been for Monsieur Georges, Paris, and the rest of them. They
      gave me my chance; going off like this has left them in the lurch. It
      isn&rsquo;t playing the game, as I understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s damages for a broken contract they&rsquo;re after, I&rsquo;ll settle that for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled mysteriously and, bowing her head above the paper, read me
      extracts, throwing in, now and then, her own vivacious comments.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that up to the last moment the theatre-management had expected
      her and had allowed the audience to assemble. They had delayed matters for
      half an hour while they sent out messengers to search for her. When the
      crowd grew restless, they had commenced the performance with an
      under-study. But the people would have none of her; they rose up in their
      places stamping and threatening, shouting for <i>La Fiesole</i>. The
      curtain had been rung down and Monsieur Georges had come forward, weeping
      and wringing his hands, saying that <i>La Fiesole</i> had been kidnaped by
      an admirer that morning. Pandemonium broke loose. The theatre for a time
      was in danger of being wrecked; but the police were summoned and got the
      audience out, and the money refunded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journalist&rsquo;s story followed of the unknown Englishman who, a few
      nights before, had stood up in his box applauding when everyone else had
      grown silent; and how the same Englishman, one night previously, had
      created a scene between himself and <i>La Fiesole</i> at a café in the
      Champs Elysées&mdash;a scene which had terminated by them going away
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make you out quite a desperate character, don&rsquo;t they, old darling?&rdquo; she
      drawled, looking up into my eyes, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did my best to share her levity, but I was secretly annoyed at so much
      publicity. Taking the paper from her, I patted her on the shoulder. &ldquo;Come,
      drink up your coffee, little woman; it&rsquo;s getting cold. Why waste time over
      all this nonsense? You&rsquo;re out of it. It&rsquo;s all ended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t. Paris won&rsquo;t let it be ended. They&rsquo;re making more row about
      me than they did about La Gioconda. They&rsquo;ve offered a reward of five
      thousand francs for my recovery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if they did find us, they couldn&rsquo;t do anything. Discovery won&rsquo;t be
      easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it? We were seen yesterday going together towards St. Cloud;
      they&rsquo;ve got the number of my car and particulars of my dress from Marie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t you warn Marie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly fellow, how should I? Didn&rsquo;t know myself what I was going to do
      when we started&mdash;at least I didn&rsquo;t know positively.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ripping, isn&rsquo;t it, for a chap like you as &lsquo;as allaws lived decent and
      &lsquo;oped to die respected? Dannie, Dannie, you&rsquo;re a regular Robert the Devil&mdash;only
      I stole you, and nobody&rsquo;ll ever believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter what they say about me; it&rsquo;s your good name that
      matters.&mdash;I promised yesterday never to speak another word about
      marriage. May I break my promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done it. Go on, John Bunyan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s my plan: that we motor through to Cherbourg and skip over to
      Southampton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get a special license in the shortest time possible. When we&rsquo;re
      discovered, you&rsquo;ll be Lady Cardover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t necessary that I should be Lady Cardover. I&rsquo;m not ashamed of
      anything. Are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not; but there&rsquo;s nothing to be gained by dodging the conventions.
      I ought to know; I&rsquo;ve been dodging &rsquo;em ever since I can remember.
      I&rsquo;ve come to see that there&rsquo;s something grand about conventions; they&rsquo;re a
      sort of wall to protect someone you love dearly from attack. We&rsquo;re man and
      wife already by everything that&rsquo;s sacred; but we shall never be securely
      happy unless we&rsquo;re married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Our meal was finished. We wandered off into the orchard at the back. When
      we were safe from watching eyes, Fiesole gave me her hand. We came to a
      place where trees grew closer together; here we rested. She leant against
      me, her face wistful and troubled; the sun through the branches scattered
      gold and the blossoms snowflakes in her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she disentangled herself from my arms, and jumped to her feet,
      smiling gently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a surprise for you, my virgin man. I want you to
      stop here for half an hour and promise not to follow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A long time to be without you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stooped over me quietly before she went. I watched her pass swaying
      across the dappled turf, under the dancing shadows and rain of petals.
      Just before she entered the courtyard, she turned and waved her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in Fiesole&rsquo;s distant aspect, something of seeming maidenly
      daintiness, brought to mind another woman&mdash;gold and ivory, with
      poppies for her lips, were the words which had described her. While I had
      walked &lsquo;Falaise that morning I had striven to banish her from my thoughts.
      And now Fiesole, from whom I had hoped to obtain forgetfulness, Fiesole
      herself had unconsciously reminded me.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the stillness I confronted myself: I was being faithless to the loyalty
      of years&mdash;I had done and was about to do a thing which was traitorous
      to all my past. Vi&rsquo;s memory, though in itself sinful, had demanded
      chastity from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet my present conduct was not incompatible with my past: it was the
      result of it. Puppy passions of thought had grown into hounds of action&mdash;that
      was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the first my pagan imagination, at war with my puritan conscience,
      had lured me on. All my life I had been breaking bounds imaginatively:
      innocently for Ruthita in my childhood; in appearance for Fiesole at
      Venice; dangerously for Vi; and at last in fact for Fiesole. Narrower
      affections I had passed by, not perceiving that their narrowness made for
      safety and kindness. The unwalled garden of masterless desire had proved a
      wilderness; its fruit was loneliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last night, sitting in the courtyard, I had told myself that in remaining
      constant to Vi, I had gambled for the impossible. Was it true? In any
      case, to have followed up the risk strongly was my only excuse for having
      gambled at all. By turning back I abandoned the prize, and made the sin of
      loving a forbidden woman paltry.&mdash;Might she not have been waiting for
      me all these years, as I had been waiting! What an irony if now, when I
      was destroying both the hope and reward of our sacrifice, she were free
      and preparing to come to me!
    </p>
    <p>
      And Fiesole! I had used her to drug my unsatisfied longing. Should I not
      do her more grievous wrong in marrying her while I loved another woman?&mdash;I
      had been mad. I was appalled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could I ever be at peace with her&mdash;ever make her happy? Fiesole was
      so flippant, so casual of all that makes for wifehood. And she was almost
      right in saying that I had made her what she was&mdash;first by my virtue,
      now by my lack of it. All we could give one another would be passion,
      swift and self-consuming. Soon would come satiety, the fruit of my doings;
      after that regret, the fruit of my thoughts. And if we did not marry, I
      should eat the same fruit, made more bitter by self-scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marry Fiesole! In marriage lay escape from the penalty of my lifelong
      lawless curiosity. Walls of children might grow up, responsibilities of
      domestic affection, giving shelter and security.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was treachery. Fiesole should never guess I had faltered. The door
      should be closed on the past&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been waiting for, perhaps, half-an-hour, when I heard the chugging
      of a motor newly started. There were no other travelers staying at the
      inn; I thought that I recognized the beat of the engine. As I listened, I
      felt sure that the car was being backed into the road. I expected to hear
      it stop, and to see Fiesole come from under the archway and signal for me.
      It did not stop. It began to gather speed. The sound droned fainter and
      fainter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Promise or no promise, I could not resist my excited curiosity. I ran
      across the orchard, through the courtyard, into the sunlit street. Far up
      the road, I saw a cloud of dust growing smaller, disappearing in the
      direction of Paris. I watched, confused and dumbfounded, as it dwindled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old proprietress approached me shyly and touched me on the arm. &ldquo;For
      Monsieur from Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Snatching the note from her hand, I tore it open with trembling fingers.
      The writing was hasty and agitated. I read and re-read it, trying to twist
      its words into another meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The note ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>My poor Dante, as you said to me, I have a woman&rsquo;s memory; you&rsquo;ll
      remember Potiphar&rsquo;s wife and Joseph. I have tried to hate you intensely.
      You see, I&rsquo;m what you made me: Lucrezia&mdash;your handiwork. For years I
      have promised myself that, if ever I had the chance, I would punish you.
      It was with this intention that I left Paris yesterday&mdash;you know the
      rest. So now, without me in the years that are to come, you will suffer
      all that you once made me suffer. And I&rsquo;m almost sorry; for here, at
      Falaise, you nearly made me.... It can&rsquo;t be done.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Raising my eyes, I stood alone, gazing along the gleaming road to Paris.
      The cloud of dust had vanished.
    </p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
